AB	Recent studies on technological transformation in developing countries emphasize that successful industrialization requires both technological information and a good understanding of its implementation. In an open economy context it is shown that the sustained gains in growth derived from a move towards an open trade regime evaporate as soon as one gives up the arguably inadequate notion of 'technology' as being all-inclusive. In this paper, technology is only implementable as the labor force has built up the corresponding skills. Trade liberalization disseminates new technologies and goods to the domestic economy, and has beneficial effects on the level of final output and consumption. But sustained growth gains are only forthcoming if in addition to the arrival of new technologies also skills are accumulated at a higher rate than before the regime change. I argue that this explains part of the variation in the long-run growth effects of trade liberalization in newly industrializing countries.

AB	Much of the prior research on interorganizational learning has focused on the role of absorptive capacity, a firm's ability to value, assimilate, and utilize new external knowledge. However, this definition of the construct suggests that a firm has an equal capacity to learn from all other organizations. We reconceptualize the Jinn-level construct absorptive capacity as a learning dyad-level construct, relative absorptive capacity. One firm's ability to learn from another firm is argued to depend on the similarity of both firms' (1) knowledge bases, (2) organizational structures and compensation policies, and (3) dominant logics. We then test the model using a sample of pharmaceutical-biotechnology RED alliances. As predicted, the similarity of the partners' basic knowledge, lower management formalization, research centralization, compensation practices, and research communities were positively related to interorganizational learning. The relative absorptive capacity measures are also shown to have greater explanatory power than the established measure of absorptive capacity, R&D spending. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB	We examine the interface between for-profit and publicly funded research in pharmaceuticals. Firms access upstream basic research through investments in absorptive capacity in the form of in-house basic research and 'pro-publication' internal incentives. Some firms also maintain extensive connections to the wider scientific community, which we measure using data on coauthorship of scientific papers between pharmaceutical company scientists and publicly funded researchers. 'Connectedness' is significantly correlated with firms' internal organization, as well as their performance in drug discovery. The estimated impact of 'connectedness' on private research productivity implies a substantial return to public investments in basic research.

AB	This paper advances the understanding of absorptive capacity for assimilating new knowledge as a mediating variable of organization adaptation. Many scholars suggest a firm's absorptive capacity plays a key role in the process of coevolution (Lewin et al., this issue). So far, most publications, in following Cohen and Levinthal (1990), have considered the level of prior related knowledge as the determinant of absorptive capacity. We suggest, however, that two specific organizational determinants of absorptive capacity should also be considered: organization forms and combinative capabilities. We will show how these organizational determinants influence the level of absorptive capacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior related knowledge. Subsequently, we will develop st framework in which absorptive capacity is related to both micro- and macro-coevolutionary effects. This framework offers an explanation of how knowledge environments coevolve with the emergence of organization forms and combinative capabilities that are suitable for absorbing knowledge. We will illustrate the framework by discussing two longitudinal case studies of traditional publishing firms moving into the turbulent knowledge environment of an emerging multimedia industrial complex.

AB	We propose a representation of a firm's 'effective' R&D effort level that reflects how both its R&D approach and R&D budget influences its ability to realize spillovers from other firms' R&D activity, i.e. its 'absorptive capacity', and generalizes the commonly employed representation. The ability to choose an R&D approach is accommodated by positing a three-stage game in which the choice of an R&D approach is made in its first stage. The firms' R&D budgets and output levels are chosen in the game's second and third stages, respectively. It is found that when firms cooperate in the setting of their R&D budgets, i.e. form a research joint venture, they choose identical broad R&D approaches. On the other hand, if they do not form a research joint venture, then they choose firm-specific R&D approaches unless there is no danger of exogenous spillovers. The analysis suggests that the commonly employed representation of firms' effective R&D investment levels implicitly presupposes that the firms have chosen to cooperate in setting their R&D budgets.

AB	This paper deals with an oligopolistic industry where firms are engaged in cost-reducing R&D activity to maximize their market shares. The existence and uniqueness of a feedback-Nash-optimal R&D strategy for each firm are discussed. Our simulations highlight that variations in spillovers hardly influence the firms R&D investment, if their absorptive capacities to exploit extramural knowledge depend on their R&D efforts. Moreover, extramural knowledge cannot completely replace in-house R&D. However, a high level of public R&D favors the firm with the most restrictive R&D expenditure constraint and/or with the lowest initial R&D stock provided it invests in R&D.

This effect, however, depends on units' absorptive capacity, or ability to successfully replicate new knowledge. Data from 24 business units in a petrochemical company and 36 business units in a food-manufacturing company show that the interaction between absorptive capacity and network position has significant, positive effects on business unit innovation and performance.

AB	This paper proposes and tests a model of IJV learning and performance that segments absorptive capacity into the three components originally proposed by Cohen and Levinthal (1990). First, trust between an IJV's parents and the IJV's relative absorptive capacity, with its foreign parent are suggested to influence its ability to understand new knowledge held by foreign parents. Second, an IJV's learning structures and processes are proposed to influence its ability to assimilate new knowledge from those parents. Third, the IJV's strategy and training competence are suggested to shape its ability to apply the assimilated knowledge. Revisiting the Him.-arian IJVs studied by Lyles and Salk, (1996) 3 years later, we find support for the knowledge understanding and application predictions, and partial support for the knowledge assimilation prediction. Unexpectedly, our results suggest that trust and management support from foreign parents are associated with IJV performance but not learning. Our model and results offer a new perspective on IJV learning and performance as well as initial insights into how those relationships change over time. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB	There are numerous studies concerning the key success factors for technology transfer performance, but little empirical research has been conducted on technology absorptive capacity. In the real world, firms cannot successfully assimilate and apply external knowledge without greater absorptive capacity. It is worthwhile exploring the critical factors of absorptive capacity through its impact on transfer performance. Results reveal significant associations between technology absorptive capacity and the critical factors technology diffusion channels, interaction mechanisms, and R&D resources. Organizational cultures impact on interaction mechanisms, R&D resources, absorptive capacity and transfer performance. Different organizations will experience different technology transfer performance. Focuses explicitly on technology absorptive capacity within the field of empirical technology transfer research. The findings are important for management practice, especially for firms carrying out technology transfer in developing countries.

The amount of knowledge firms can absorb is made dependent on their own research efforts, e.g., firms' absorptive capacity is treated as an endogenous variable. It is shown that cooperating firms invest more in R&D than noncooperating firms if spillovers are sufficiently large. The degree of market competition is a key determinant of the effects of research cooperation on research efforts, implying that existing models, which usually assume perfect competition, might be too restrictive.

AB	This paper presents a single unified framework that integrates the theoretical literature on Schumpeterian endogenous growth and major strands of the empirical literature on R&D, productivity growth and productivity convergence. Starting from a structural model of endogenous growth following Aghion and Howitt (1992, 1998), we provide microeconomic foundations for the reduced-form equations for total factor productivity (TFP) growth frequently estimated empirically using industry-level data. R&D affects both innovation and the assimilation of others' discoveries ("absorptive capacity"). Long-run cross-country differences in productivity emerge endogenously, and the analysis implies that many existing studies underestimate R&D's social rate of return by neglecting absorptive capacity.

By testing the different dimensions of absorptive capacity, external knowledge acquisition and intrafirm knowledge dissemination were found to be positively related to organizational responsiveness. In addition, the relationships between absorptive capacity and organizational responsiveness were moderated by environmental dynamism and the SMEs' strategic orientation. Results demonstrate that the responsiveness of growth-oriented SMEs is expected to increase if (1) they have well-developed capabilities in external knowledge acquisition and intrafirm knowledge dissemination; (2) they have a well-developed external knowledge acquisition capability and adopt a more proactive strategy, such as being a prospector; (3) they face a turbulent environment and have a well developed internal knowledge dissemination capability. Implications and future research directions are provided.

AB	In this paper, we analyse how R&D investment decisions are affected by R&D spillovers between firms, taking into consideration that more R&D investment improves the ability to learn from competing firms-the so-called absorptive capacity effect of R&D. Contrary to earlier studies, we show that absorptive capacity effects of own R&D do not necessarily drive up the incentive to invest in R&D. This only happens when the market size is small or the absorptive capacity effect is weak. Otherwise, firms will actually choose to cut down on R&D. Furthermore, absorptive capacity effects also increase the critical rate of spillovers that determines whether a research joint venture generates more R&D investment than a non-cooperative setting. Finally, we show that strong learning effects of own R&D are not necessarily good for welfare. Moreover, if the market size is large, welfare will be at its highest when the learning effect is small.

Researchers have investigated how managers may develop absorptive capacity by building internal knowledge stocks, but few have focused on the distribution of this knowledge within the firm and the role managers play in administering information to organizational subunits. In this paper, we explore the degree to which managers can develop absorptive capacity by directly providing information to agents in the organization that might potentially adopt a new practice. We find that the effectiveness of managerial information provision depends on the degree to which potential adopters have information from other sources. We find that information from previous adopters and past events reduces the effect of information provision, while experience with related practices amplifies it.

In this paper, our unit of analysis is a complex high technology product and the system of alliance linkages formed to progress a product through R&D milestones. We present a model and evidence for advancing our understanding of how achieving early-to-market returns depends on systemic absorptive capacity. This systemic absorptive capacity is the cumulative efficiency in the use of absorptive capacity to link changing lead innovators across successive milestones in R&D product development. We advance propositions of how systemic absorptive capacity can explain performance differences between rival product development systems competing for early-to-market returns with similar products through accelerating speed to market, cost and quality advantages. These explanations are contrasted with the conclusions of previous studies that have focused on absorptive capacity of single firms or single alliances in RD.

AB	In high technology environments, rapid technological change means that the value of a firm's existing knowledge is quickly eroded. In order to acquire needed capabilities, high technology new ventures engage in venturing strategies such as acquisitions and joint ventures. The top management team is an important source of inherited knowledge for these ventures and therefore influences their absorptive capacity. We hypothesise that high technology new ventures' ability to learn through venturing activities is influenced by their top management teams' human capital. This study analyses the human capital characteristics of the top management teams of 340 high technology new ventures from the USA. It is found that human capital diversity of the top management teams moderates the relationship between venturing activities and innovation and financial performance in these ventures. In contrast, the level of human capital has no effect. The implications for management practice and future research are discussed.

AB	The need for continual value innovation is driving supply chains to evolve from a pure transactional focus to leveraging interorganizational partner ships for sharing information and, ultimately, market knowledge creation. Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge. This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems. We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation. Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities.
Through an exploratory field study conducted in the context of the RosettaNet consortium effort in the IT industry supply chain, we use cluster analysis to uncover and characterize five supply chain partnership configurations (collectors, connectors, crunchers, coercers, and collaborators). We compare their partner-enabled knowledge creation and operational efficiency, as well as the shortcomings in their capability platforms and the nature of information exchange. Through the characterization of each of the configurations, we are able to derive research propositions focused on enterprise absorptive capacity elements. These propositions provide insight into how partner-enabled market knowledge creation and operational efficiency can be affected, and highlight the interconnected roles of coordination information and rich information. The paper concludes by drawing implications for research and practice from the uncovering of these configurations and the resultant research propositions. It also highlights fertile opportunities for advances in research on knowledge management through the study of supply chain contexts and other interorganizational partnering arrangements.

AB	This paper seeks to establish the role of absorptive capacity in technology transfer from acquisition FDI in U.K. manufacturing. It finds that the rate of productivity change following a foreign takeover is higher the higher the pre-acquisition productivity level of the acquired firm, indicating the importance of absorptive capacity. However, beyond some critical level of initial productivity, the rate of technology transfer due to foreign acquisition starts to decline. It seems that U.K. acquisition targets that had been operating nearer the domestic technology frontier have less to gain from their association with foreign multinationals.

AB	This paper explores the endogenous determination of R&D appropriability through the firms' choice of R&D approaches. Whereas identical broad R&D approaches 'connect' firms with their R&D environment and maximize absorptive capacities, the opposite holds for idiosyncratic R&D approaches. Our model shows that competing firms choose identical R&D approaches in order to maximize knowledge flows between each other. In essence, this frees firms from the 'prisoner's dilemma' of aggressive investment in R&D. Our analysis contrasts with Kamien and Zang's (2000) [Kamien, M., Zang, I., 2000. Meet me halfway: research joint ventures and absorptive capacity. International Journal of Industrial Organization 18 995-1012] finding that competing firms chose idiosyncratic R&D approaches. We demonstrate that their model also yields a Nash equilibrium for broad identical R&D approaches. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	This paper explores whether the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on productivity growth is dependent on absorptive capacity using recently developed threshold regression techniques. In manufacturing sectors where technology-exploiting multinationals are prevalent, the results point to the presence of nonlinear threshold effects: the productivity benefit from FDI increases with absorptive capacity until some threshold level beyond which it becomes less pronounced. But there is also a minimum absorptive capacity threshold level below which productivity spillovers from FDI are negligible or even negative. On the contrary, no evidence of productivity spillovers is found in sectors where FDI appears to be motivated by technology-sourcing considerations.

AB	This article provides a firm-centred interpretation of why some industrial clusters forge ahead and others lag behind. It argues that the dynamic growth of a cluster depends on its absorptive capacity and therefore on the capacity of firms to absorb external knowledge and diffuse it into the intra-cluster knowledge system. This article speculates on the relationship existing between the heterogeneity of firms' knowledge bases with both intra- and extra-cluster knowledge systems. It concludes by illustrating that a conceptual link exists between firm-level knowledge bases, the cluster absorptive capacity and its potential for growth.

AB	The marketing and strategy literature hail strategic flexibility as a key success factor in creating continuously customer value and generating competitive advantage. However, empirical evidence indicates that rigidity in market strategies and actions is more the rule than the exception in organizations. The focus of this special issue is on better understanding rigidity and flexibility in business markets. This lead article seeks to elaborate on why companies face rigidity and how they can create flexibility. To do this, we relate rigidity in organizations to the concepts of dominant logic, industry recipe and persistence. The case illustrations highlight barriers to the development of absorptive capacity in business organizations. Identifying such barriers is a first step in better understanding how companies can remain agile and flexible in demanding and fast changing markets. The paper then proceeds with a brief introduction to the other contributions of this special issue and concludes with a research agenda. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However the wide array of approaches to studying absorptive capacity has obscured our understanding of what drives the effective use of external knowledge. The authors show that absorptive capacity is composed of mutliple dimensions: (a) the firm's relationship to its external environment; (b) the structure, routines, and knowledge base of the main value creation group(s); and (c) individuals' absorptive abilities. Their data illustrate that each of these dimensions contributes to increased knowledge or knowledge creation activities.

AB	This article examines several constraints on aid effectiveness associated with the key problem of absorptive capacity, and then proposes an array of actions to address these problems. The constraints take diverse forms: macroeconomic; institutional and policy-oriented; technical and managerial; and those associated with donor behaviour. The constraints can be eased if donors do their homework; harmonise and align their strategies; design interventions with cared pay attention to macroeconomic management; renew their focus on infrastructure; and adopt innovative delivery mechanisms. The article concludes with an agenda for research which can facilitate such efforts. It is important to analyse successful examples of macroeconomic management in periods when aid flows increased; political economy factors driving countries' development strategy choices, including the incentives created by domestic politics and by aid relationships; as well as particularly effective sectoral strategies, the use of natural resource rents, and of reform efforts that allowed for a significant step-change in public sector performance.

AB	This paper analyses the influence of two variables related with industrial structure (technological opportunity and knowledge spillovers) and one management variable (absorptive capacity) on the innovative efforts developed by firms. These relationships are investigated in a total of 406 Spanish manufacturing companies with an established degree of innovative activity. In addition the nature of the variable,absorptive capacity' is considered and an index is suggested that would render this concept operational through analysis of the factors defining it and by which the process of building it up is influenced. As a result of this study it is demonstrated that the absorptive capacity variable determines innovative effort to a greater extent than the two structural variables. It is also shown that absorptive capacity has a moderating effect on the relationship between technological opportunity and innovative effort being this one of the most remarkable results obtained from the work.

Results indicate that organizational mechanisms associated with coordination capabilities (cross-functional interfaces, participation in decision making, and job rotation) primarily enhance a unit's potential absorptive capacity. Organizational mechanisms associated with socialization capabilities (connectedness and socialization tactics) primarily increase a unit's realized absorptive capacity. Our findings reveal why units may have difficulty managing levels of potential and realized absorptive capacity and vary in their ability to create value from their absorptive capacity.

AB	By establishing an endogenous growth model with knowledge-driven R&D, this paper aims to investigate the relationship between international technology spillovers, the host country's absorptive capability and endogenous economic growth. The solution to the competitive equilibrium problem shows that long-run growth arises from improvements in absorptive capability and higher human capital stocks, while the relationships between openness, the technology gap and the steady-state growth rate are uncertain. Econometric estimates of China's economic growth are obtained using province level data covering the period 1996-2002. The estimates indicate that technology spillovers depend on the host country's human capital investment and degree of openness, and that FDI is a more significant spillover channel than imports.

First, we show that incorporating absorptive capacity has different effects according as the firm leads or follows in the race. While the leader is getting soft, the follower revives, allowing him to possibly catch up with the leader. Second, we find that spillovers with absorptive capacities tend to increase the pace of innovation, a somewhat paradoxical outcome.

We investigate whether differences in absorptive capacity help to explain cross-country differences in the level of productivity. We utilize stochastic frontier analysis to investigate two potential sources of this inefficiency - differences in human capital and R&D - for nine industries in 12 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the period 1973-91. We find that inefficiency in production does indeed exist and it depends upon the level of human capital of the country's workforce. Evidence that the amount of R&D an industry undertakes is also important is less robust.

It argues that faculty support for the objectives of university-industry relations (UIR) does not vary across disciplines and does not respond to university encouragement in a region with low absorptive capacity. These results are in contrast with those obtained in studies of technology leading countries like the USA. Furthermore, incentives for UIR may generate unpredicted dynamics while instruments to cooperate are not significant. Finally, support for the objectives of UIR should not be confused with the degree of R&D cooperation. The former is sensitive to university age while the latter is sensitive to gender, discipline, commitment to R&D and university encouragement. Empirical evidence is obtained from a sample of faculty from the Valencian Community (Spain) and analysed through a set of models for discrete choice. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, we aim to establish whether labour market aspects of RACAP are more important for innovation in prosperous or lagging regions of the European Union (EU).

AB	Increasingly, manufacturers are making radical changes in management practices and investing heavily in advanced technologies as they attempt to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Organizations seeking to implement these changes should have an internal environment that emphasizes knowledge assimilation and sharing and creates continuous learning capability, i.e., absorptive capacity. This study reviews the construct of absorptive capacity, develops a valid and reliable instrument to measure it, and examines its impact on the organization's ability to assimilate innovative manufacturing technology and management practice. To illustrate the links, this study tests the relationships among absorptive capacity, time-based manufacturing practices, and value to customer. Structural equation modeling, applied to a relatively large sample (n = 303), indicates strong, positive, and direct relationships between absorptive capacity and time-based manufacturing practices, and between time-based manufacturing practices and value to customer. The managerial implications of these empirical findings are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a recent literature review Zahra and George identify two distinct elements of absorptive capacity (potential and realized). This article contributes to the study of managerial agency in the absorption of new knowledge and skills. Zahra and George's model is extended to incorporate key roles associated with knowledge transfer, including gatekeepers, boundary spanners and change agents. Empirical data are drawn from a longitudinal study of a mature manufacturing firm based in North Wales. Change was initiated by the owner in response to the loss of the company's major customer-the Ministry of Defence. The main change agent was a recently recruited middle manager who used his mass production experience to improve managerial communications and introduce more efficient working practices to the shopfloor.

AB	he rapid rate of knowledge obsolescence in many high-technology markets makes it imperative for firms to renew their technological bases constantly. Given its critical importance, excellence in renewal of technological base would serve as a dynamic capability. Drawing on past literature, we identify this dynamic capability associated with acquiring and utilizing external technological know-how with the notion of absorptive capacity (AC).
We ask the following questions: (a) What would cause some firms to have a higher AC than others? and, (b) What is the impact of AC on a firm's profitability?
We build a conceptual framework suggesting that marketing, R&D, and operations capabilities have a significant positive impact on a firm's AC. We test our framework on a data set of firms in high-technology markets. Using an econometric technique called stochastic frontier estimation, we infer the AC of firms from an observation of the know-how they actually absorb. We find that firm-specific capabilities significantly impact AC. Also, we find that AC has a significant impact on profitability and that this impact is moderated by the pace of technological change: the greater the pace of change, the greater the impact.

Owing to the importance to competitiveness of increasing innovative capabilities in manufacturing it is highly relevant to explore how a wide community of manufacturing experts experience the phenomenon of absorptive capacity and sense future developments.
Design/methodology/approach - A two round Delphi method was designed in which more than 3,000 experts from 22 European countries assessed 101 statements. This paper discusses eight statements focused on the issue of absorptive capacity.
Findings - The results show a general consensus about the influence of different inter-firm relationships in acquiring external knowledge and a diversified knowledge structure for assimilating the acquired knowledge. The study also indicates some potential challenges and contradictions in managing inter-firm relationships and knowledge diversity as well as perceived barriers for future developments of absorptive capacity.
Research limitations/implications - Delphi survey is an empirical method subject to the limitation of testing or inductively building theoretical concepts.
Practical implications - The results of the Delphi study are predominantly centred on policy implication and on informing strategic decision-making at manufacturing firms.
Originality/value - This paper discusses one of the biggest Delphi surveys ever conducted in Europe. Its comprehensiveness increases the value of the results.

It also shows that knowledge sharing has a positive effect on absorptive capacity, and that a completely mediating model exhibits both model generalization and extension characteristics through multiple model comparison in different industry population samples. Finally, managerial implications are discussed and a brief conclusion is presented.

A rereading of the seminal Cohen and Levinthal (1990) article in light of current research on learning and innovation directs our attention to serious ambiguities and omissions in Zahra and George's reconceptualization. We suggest a reintroduction of "recognizing the value," an alternative understanding of "transformation." a clarification of "potential absorptive capacity," an elaboration of the impact of socialization mechanisms, an investigation of the role of "power relationships," and an inclusion of feedback loops in a dynamic model of absorptive capacity.

The key finding is that the hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped effect of cognitive distance on innovation performance of firms is confirmed. Moreover, as expected, we found that the positive effect for firms is much higher when engaging in more radical, exploratory alliances than in more exploitative alliances. The effect of cumulative R&D turns out to be mixed. It appears to increase absorptive capacity, as expected, but there is clear evidence that it also reduces the effect of cognitive distance on novelty value, making it increasingly difficult to find additional novelty.

AB	Empirical evidence strongly suggests that R&D increases a firm's "absorptive capacity" (its ability to absorb spillovers from other firms) as well as contributing directly to profitability. We explore the theoretical implications of this. We specify a general model of the absorptive capacity process and show that costly absorption both raises the effectiveness of own R&D and lowers the effective spillover coefficient. This weakens the case for encouraging research joint ventures, even if there is complete information sharing between members It also implies an additional strategic pay-off to policies that raise the level of extra-industry knowledge.

AB	This article empirically investigates the relationship between innovation activities of firms, their use of appropriation instruments and their absorptive capacity. We study a wide range of manufacturing and service industries, not just high-tech, and a wide range of innovation activities, not just R&D. We use multilevel logit models for complex samples to disentangle industry from firm-specific effects. We find that within an industry, firms that invest in appropriation instruments to reduce outgoing spillovers tend to conduct more R&D and downstream activities than firms that do not. Acquisition of technology is not related to the use of appropriation instruments. The effects of incoming spillovers (measured through absorptive capacity) on innovation activities of firms are industry specific and stronger for firms that invest in appropriation instruments. For this type of firm, both the capability to scan the external environment for technology and the capability to integrate new technology are related to the innovation activities. For firms that do not invest in appropriation instruments, only scanning capabilities are related. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	Previous empirical studies show mixed support for the hypothesis that the impact of technology diffusion from multinational enterprises (MNEs) on host country productivity growth depends on host country absorptive capacity. One explanation is that the results of these empirical studies are sensitive to the measures of absorptive capacity used. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by investigating average years of schooling and total factor productivity gap as measures of host country absorptive capacity in 38 developed and developing countries. Panel data regression equations are estimated using a cross-sectionally heteroskedastic and timewise autoregressive (CHTA) model. The paper has two main results. The first result does not support the hypothesis that the technology diffusion from MNEs has a positive impact on the productivity growth in developing countries. The second result is that the total factor productivity gap is more appropriate than average years of schooling to measure host country absorptive capacity. This may suggest that the results of previous studies that used average years of schooling should be interpreted with caution.

AB	The author is involved in a multi-year programme to establish a number of large-scale manufacturing SME collaboration projects. It was anticipated that some web-based tools used previously by larger firms could be adapted, but limits in the capabilities of the participant firms and the emergence of a different business model led to a change in approach. Participants had quite diverse internal ICT capabilities that might be used for bidding collaboratively for manufacturing contracts, or for operating as an extended enterprise. Some way of mapping the functional project needs and comparing these with participant capabilities was needed. In this paper an adaptation of the notion of absorptive capacity where both a firm's resource base and its knowledge base are considered is used as a framework to better understand participant requirements. This was subsequently used in building a web-based virtual enterprise support system that utilized simple, lowest cost system components.

AB	This paper examines the existence of externalities associated with foreign direct investment (FDI) in a host country by exploiting firm-level panel data covering the Polish corporate sector. We distinguish between horizontal spillovers (from foreign to domestic firms operating in the same industry) and two types of vertical spillovers: backward (from FDI in downstream industries) and forward spillovers (from FDI in upstream industries). The main findings are as follows. Local firms benefit from foreign presence in the same industry and in downstream industries. The absorptive capacity of domestic firms is highly relevant to the size of spillovers: vertical spillovers are larger for RD-intensive firms, while firms investing in other (external) types of intangibles benefit more from horizontal spillovers. Competitive pressure facilitates backward spillovers, while market power increases the extent of forward spillovers. Horizontal spillovers are particularly strong in services, while the remaining results, including backward spillovers and the role of absorptive capacity and competition, are mainly driven by manufacturing. Host country equity participation in foreign firms is consistent with higher unconditional productivity spillovers to domestic firms. A number of robustness checks yield results qualitatively similar to those obtained in the baseline specification.

AB	The development of clusters rests on geographical proximity, cognitive interactions as well as entrepreneurial initiatives. Sophia Antipolis, a multi-technology cluster in Valbonne, France, is a good illustration of the type of challenges local systems of innovation face in creating positive knowledge externalities. This paper shows that if the existence of 'gatekeepers of knowledge' can generate the potential implementation of 'absorptive capacity', its effective realization requires some additional effort regarding the transfer of knowledge into the cluster. The concept of 'platform of knowledge' defined shows how a project of knowledge codification could generate externalities by creating new opportunities for effectively combining and absorbing knowledge.

AB	This paper analyses the spatial mobility of knowledge and technology transfer and measures the economic impact on the geo-economic space. The data of laboratories operating in different research and technological fields are used. The results show that, when the distance from the source of knowledge (research institute) to users increases, the impact of knowledge and technology transfer decreases with damped pulsations. The magnitude of knowledge and technology transfer shows a high intensity within the industrial district because small businesses are able to acquire externally scientific knowledge, without conducting in-house research, but by interactions with public scientific bodies and adopting both collective rules that act as collective knowledge devices, making collective learning possible, and skilled labor.

AB	The hypothesis that absorptive capacity leads to greater innovation/productivity has been supported at the country, inter-organizational, organizational, and group levels. We adapted the absorptive capacity concept to individuals engaged in IT enabled engineering work, which is a situated and emergent phenomenon that requires individuals to posses or develop ability to acquire new task and computer knowledge; use or develop analytical and intuitive problem solving skills to assimilate and integrate these two types of knowledge; and apply them to their work.
A model was developed linking the absorptive capacity of individuals, through enhanced IT utilization for problem solving/decision support, to task innovation and productivity. It was tested using a sample of 208 engineers using computers in their work. The results suggested that using IT innovatively and productively in such a work environment requires a mix of task knowledge, computer knowledge, and problem solving modalities.

Yet, research evidence on the performance benefits of international venturing activities has been contradictory. Applying an organizational learning framework, we propose that the expected effects of international venturing activities on financial performance depend on companies' absorptive capacity. Data from 217 global manufacturing companies show that absorptive capacity moderates the relationship between international venturing and firms' profitability and revenue growth. These results urge executives to build internal R&D and innovative capabilities in order to successfully exploit the new knowledge acquired from foreign markets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB	This paper builds upon the theoretical framework developed by Zahra and George [Absorptive capacity: a review, reconceptualization, and extension. Academy of Management Review 2002;27:185-203] to empirically explore the antecedents of potential absorptive capacity (PAC), i.e. the ability to identify and assimilate external knowledge flows. Based on a sample of 2464 innovative Spanish firms, we find evidence that R&D cooperation, external knowledge acquisition and experience with knowledge search are key antecedents of a firm's PAC. Also, during periods of important internal reshaping, when there are significant changes in strategy, design of the organization and marketing, firms exert more effort to accumulate PAC. Finally, we find that PAC is a source of competitive advantage in innovation, especially in the presence of efficient internal knowledge flows that help reduce the distance between potential and realized capacity.

AB	This paper examines the role of teaming in corporate restructuring. Drawing from two viewpoints of organizational learning, absorptive capacity and organizational improvisation, we examine whether experience with corporate restructuring modes (sell-offs, spin-ofts) influences subsequent restructuring and financial performance. Consistent with an absorptive capacity view, cumulative and repetitive experience with sell-offs was related to the adoption of an ensuing sell-off and to higher performance. Conversely, and consistent with an organizational improvisation view, short-term and contemporaneous experience with spin-ofts was related to the subsequent use of spin-offs and to increases in financial performance. The findings contribute to a dynamic explanation of corporate restructuring and its influence on financial performance, illustrate differences between learning in a repetitive situation and teaming when repetition is rare, and indicate when absorptive capacity and organizational improvisational views are most profitable. Overall, these findings show that different kinds of restructuring experiences were associated with different modes of restructuring and performance records. Considered collectively, the organizational learning perspective offers insights into why some corporate restructuring strategies appear as intentional and deliberate actions while others resemble more spontaneous and simultaneous responses.

AB	Managerial ties-the boundary-spanning ties and interpersonal connections of top managers-contribute to a corporation's innovativeness in emerging economies because of the absence of market supporting institutions, transparent laws, and clear regulations. Moreover, managerial ties are apt to interact with absorptive capacity to facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation. This paper examines the joint influence of managerial ties and absorptive capacity in two communities in China, one characterized by a high level of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the other consisting mainly of local corporations. We find that absorptive capacity moderates the effect of managerial ties on a corporation's innovativeness. Furthermore, when examining the two communities separately, we find that business ties and university ties have opposite effects.

AB	Numerous publications are dedicated to absorptive capacity and new product development (NPD). Most are centered on the recipient team, and very few consider the effects of the source team knowledge characteristics on the knowledge absorption and the NPD performance. This paper analyzes the type of the external knowledge sourced from outside the organization and the process through which it is used by the recipient firm and the effect on NPD performance. This is done through a specific type of source team knowledge, the design, and through the NPD process in industries (clothing and construction) where it plays a key role. NPD cases were analyzed and clustered in three categories of design absorption processes. From these categories, a conceptual framework of the source-recipient knowledge complementarity and its impact on the NPD performance is proposed. The main result is that the complementarity between the recipient and the source knowledge is a critical aspect of the absorption process and therefore of the NPD performance. From a managerial perspective, this research highlights the role of design in the NPD process and how the combination of design knowledge with prior knowledge (marketing or technological) is related to NPD performance.

AB	This article proposes a new model for analyzing the determinants of absorptive capacity in companies. We suggest that absorptive capacity is determined not only by research and development activities, but also by a set of internal factors, which we group into three basic categories: organizational knowledge, formalization, and social integration mechanisms. In addition, we suggest that these factors may influence all components of the firm's absorptive capacity, and that the influence can be positive or negative depending on the applicability of the knowledge being absorbed. This paper thus advances the understanding of absorptive capacity by exploring a largely ignored aspect in the literature: the role of knowledge attributes. We show how the model can be operationalized and empirically tested and provide preliminary evidence supporting most of the propositions in the analytical model.

Based on an empirical study of the TAMA cluster project (in the western part of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area), which is a model project of the 'Industrial Cluster Plan' in Japan, we examine the intermediation effect of the TAMA Association and the 'absorptive capacity' of various product-developing SMEs. These two elements are interrelated because the participation of the product-developing SMEs is a prerequisite for the effective functioning of an intermediary such as the TAMA Association. Our analysis also shows that university-industry linkages and inter-firm linkages lead to different outcomes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this case we analyzed the citations to a very influential paper published in 1990 that contains, for the first time, the term Absorptive Capacity. A bibliometric map identified the terms and the theories associated with the term while two techniques from the citation network analysis recognized the main papers during 15 years. As a result we identified the articles that influenced the research for some time and linked them into a research tradition that can be considered the backbone of the "Absorptive Capacity Field".

AB	Absorptive capacity is regarded as an important factor in both corporate innovation and general competitive advantage. The concept was initially developed largely from reviews of the literature and has subsequently been extended by empirical studies, although some people suggest that progress since 1990 has been disappointing. This article argues that this limited development results from the dominance of quantitative studies which have failed to develop insights into the processes of absorptive capacity, and builds on recent qualitative studies which have successfully opened up new perspectives. Using case studies drawn from three different sectors, the article argues that a process perspective on absorptive capacity should include the role of power in the way knowledge is absorbed by organizations, and provide better understanding of the nature of boundaries within and around organizations.

AB	In this paper, we explore the relationship between aspects of firms' potential absorptive capacity (PACAP) on their involvement in exploratory alliances. Our study is based on survey data from firms in the US and European (the UK, Germany, France and Ireland) biopharmaceutical sectors. We use zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models to capture the number of exploratory alliances in which firms are engaged, and find that the assimilation dimension of PACAP is significantly more important than the acquisition dimension. More specifically, we find that skill levels and continuous R&D play an important role in determining biopharmaceutical firms' exploratory alliance activity, while R&D intensity proves relatively unimportant. Our results also highlight differences between the determinants of alliance behaviour in the US and Europe: in the US firms' skill levels prove more significant, while in Europe continuity of R&D proves more significant. Commonalities are also observed, however, with firms' strategic focus and an inverted 'U' shaped relationship between firm size and alliance engagement evident in both areas.

AB	A fundamental result of the information technology (IT) and business performance literature is that IT is not a driver of performance per se. However, it can be associated with higher performance if accompanied by organizational change. The identification of the variables describing organizational change is still on-going work. This paper focuses on organizational absorptive capacity and analyses its effects on the relationship between IT and business performance in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Organizational absorptive capacity measures the ability of an organization to complete a learning process. A significant learning effort is typically associated with IT, as it represents a complex technology. To cope with IT's complexity, implementation is typically incremental and is accompanied by a continuous integration effort of data and applications. The degree of integration of a company's information system (IS), called IS integration, is a proxy of IT maturity and quality. In this study, we explore the effect of IS integration on business performance through absorptive capacity, that is, we hypothesize that absorptive capacity has a mediation role between IS integration and business performance. The proposed research model is tested with data surveyed from 466 SMEs sited in Italy, for which exports constitute more than half of their revenues. Results indicate that organizational absorptive capacity has a mediation effect. Alternative models attributing to absorptive capacity a role different from mediation are found to be non-significant.

AB	Absorptive capacity is the principle that assimilating new knowledge requires prior knowledge. The attendant prescription is to invest more in R&D to derive greater benefit from the R&D of others (spillovers). Empirical tests of R&D productivity typically find absorptive capacity (R&D* rival R&D) to be significant. This result poses a puzzle, however: What can a firm conducting 50% of industry R&D learn from a set of firms each conducting 5%? Aren't the laggard firms merely playing catch-up? Yet, if this is so, why is the interaction term significant?
One possible resolution to this puzzle is that the correlation between R&D spending and returns is really about innate ability (IQ) rather than investment behavior (absorptive capacity). In this view the causality between capability and behavior is reversed. It is not that firms obtain higher returns by investing more in R & D; it is that some firms have higher returns to R&D, thus they invest more. I conduct an empirical test of the competing views and find that (1) firms differ in the output elasticities of their own R&D (IQ) as well as the elasticities of spillovers from rivals, (2) absorptive capacity becomes insignificant when accounting for that heterogeneity, (3) R&D investment increases with IQ, but (4) R&D investment has no impact on firm's ability to benefit from spillovers.

AB	Before World War II, Dutch State Mines, the national, state owned coal corporation, was confronted with major challenges, specifically that foreign coal was sold at dumping prices in the home market. At the same time, coal cleaning needed to be improved in order to offer higher quality coal against lower coal processing costs. In this paper we illustrate how State Mines relied on its innovative capacity in order to overcome the economic, technological and market changes. The coal cleaning innovations at State Mines show how absorptive capacity was of prime importance for the firm's innovative capacity. External knowledge acquisition as well as internal knowledge building proved to be relevant, although the balance changed over time. While initially acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge (potential absorptive capacity) were essential to improve the existing coal cleaning processes, internal knowledge building was needed to come to real improvements in coal cleaning. The establishment of a licensing company was essential to exploit this knowledge. An important feature was that State Mines was always well aware of its lack of capabilities and knowledge and open to search for and learn from knowledge outside its firm boundaries. Moreover, expectations determined the search for external knowledge.

AB	Global Manufacturing Network (GMN) is an innovative manufacturing system that provides great opportunities for local firms in developing countries to acquire knowledge and upgrade through collaborations in GMN. Using data of manufacturing firms, we confirm the conceptual model that local firm's absorptive capacity can contribute to its knowledge acquisition and performance in the context of GMN. Furthermore, our finding also suggests that firm's abilities to understand external knowledge will be more positively associated with its knowledge acquisition when the information embeddedness is high, and firm's abilities to apply external knowledge and knowledge acquisition will be more positively associated with the firm performance when the work embeddedness is high.

AB	This paper models the determinants of exporting (both in terms of export propensity and export intensity), with a particular emphasis on the importance of absorptive capacity and the endogenous link between exporting and undertaking RD. Based on a merged dataset of the 2001 Community Innovation Survey and the 2000 Annual Respondents Database for the UK, our results suggest that establishment size plays a fundamental role in explaining exporting. Meanwhile, alongside other factors, undertaking RD activities and having greater absorptive capacity (for scientific knowledge, international co-operation, and organizational structure) significantly reduce entry barriers into export markets, having controlled for self-selectivity into exporting. Nevertheless, conditional on entry into international markets, only greater absorptive capacity (associated with scientific knowledge) seems to further boost export performance in such markets, whereas spending on RD no longer has an impact on exporting behaviour once we have taken into account its endogenous nature.

Based on absorptive capacity (ACAP) theory, we emphasize ACAP's separation into potential and realized knowledge and suggest that each should be associated with three-dimensional stocks and distinguish between managing knowledge stocks and knowledge flows. Data from 522 managers from 12 Israli hospitals support the theoretical model. Organizations that manage both potential and realized ACAP stocks achieve better performance in a turbulent environment. The paper explores the practical and theoretical contivutions of the new suggested framework by linking environmental competitiveness, ACAP stocks, and performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of this study showed that relationship learning and absorptive capacity positively influence upon innovation performances of companies, and further have positive effects on competitive advantages of companies. In addition, this study divided the sample into three groups by the levels of relationship learning and absorptive capacity and found that there was a significant difference of innovation performance among these three groups: 'Highly Capable Companies', 'Medially Capable Companies', and 'Lowly Capable Companies'. It is important for 'Lowly Capable Companies' to increase both of their relationship learning and absorptive capacity to enhance their innovation performances. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We argue in favour of a negative effect of financial constraints and provide reasons for a differential effect of internal and external R&D on innovation adoption. Additionally, the methodology allows us to consider the possible complementarities arising when firms adopt several new process technologies. Our results show that financial constraints are dependent on the technology analyzed, whereas only internal R&D investments are strong predictors of adoption. We are also able to present evidence that the three technologies analyzed (numerically controlled machines, computer aided design and robotics) are, to some extent, complementary.

AB	Successful research commercialisation within the university domain is predicated upon basic research being developed into technology that will attract funding, ultimately resulting in entities such as University spin-out companies or licensing arrangements. This development process involves considerable risk and uncertainty and may require substantial resources to fund early stage operations while returns are uncertain. Hence there is a need to explore risk-minimisation approaches relating to proving the potential for development while concurrently allocating resources in an incremental manner. This paper focuses on the development of the Northern Ireland Proof of Concept (PoC) process within a University Science Park Incubator (USI) as a particular approach to addressing these challenges inherent in the United Kingdom University technology transfer. Furthermore, Absorptive Capacity has emerged in the literature as an appropriate theoretical framework or lens for exploring the development and application of new technology. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the PoC process within a USI as a means for improving the commercialisation of University technology transfer using an Absorptive Capacity perspective. A multiple case analysis of PoC applications within a UK university is described. From the findings it emerges that Absorptive Capacity influencing factors such as levels of R&D investment, prior knowledge base and integration of stakeholder and technology planning all impact on PoC outcomes. In addition a number of process improvement areas for PoC are identified in relation to the influencing factors within the Absorptive Capacity framework.

Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) activities give these firms a foundation for building and exploiting these capabilities. In turn, stimulating and sustaining CE requires the infusion of resources and new knowledge into the firm's operations, using multiple external sources. In this paper, we highlight the importance of boards of directors and absorptive capacity for gaining access to varied and current knowledge that enriches CE. We suggest that boards and absorptive capacity complement each other in fueling CE activities. Further, boards can sometimes substitute for poor absorptive capacity and vice versa, influencing the intensity of CE activities. Managing these complementarities (or substitutions) is crucial for sustaining CE initiatives and creating value from them. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	A firm's organizational and technological boundaries are two important demarcation lines when sourcing for technology. Based on this theoretical lens, four possible combinations of exploration and exploitation emerge. Applying an ambidexterity perspective to a firm's technology sourcing strategy, we hypothesize that a curvilinear relationship exists between a firm's technology sourcing mix and its performance. We further introduce a contingency element by proposing that a firm's absorptive capacity exerts a positive moderating effect on this relationship. We empirically test these hypotheses on a random, multi-industry sample of U. S. manufacturing companies. We find support for the notion that the relationship between technology sourcing mix and firm performance is an inverted U-shape. Moreover, higher levels of absorptive capacity allow a firm to more fully capture the benefits resulting from ambidexterity in technology sourcing.

Data from a multi-informant survey conducted in 175 industrial firms show that exploratory, transformative, and exploitative learning have complementary effects on innovation and performance. The results emphasize the multidimensional nature of absorptive capacity, and they help to explain interfirm discrepancies in profiting from external knowledge. Moreover, the findings underscore the importance of dynamic capabilities in contexts characterized by high degrees of technological and market turbulence.

We argue that results can vary if we take the region as the context of analysis, especially if it is a region with low absorptive capacity, and if we study applicant citations and examiner-inserted citations separately. Using a sample from the Valencian Community (Spain), we conclude that (i) the use of examiner-inserted citations as a proxy for applicant citations, (ii) the interpretation of non-patent references as indicators of science-industry links, and (iii) the traditional results for geographical localization are not generalizable to all regions with low absorptive capacity.

AB	Firms fund research and development (R&D) to generate commercializable innovations and to increase their ability to understand and absorb knowledge from elsewhere. This dual role and opposed incentive structure of internal R&D create a significant question for both theory and R&D policy: Is internal R&D a complement or substitute for external R&D? We develop a model and novel technique for empirically estimating R&D substitution elasticities. We focus on bio-pharmaceutical and software industries in California and Massachusetts, where tax credit rates changed differently over time for the two types of R&D, creating a natural experiment. The effective tax prices for the two R&D types differ from type to type, firm to firm, state to state, and year to year. This allows us to examine changes in the composition of firms' R&D budgets between in-house R&D and external basic research when the relative tax prices of each category of research change. We find evidence of a substitute relationship both for a sample comprising exclusively small firms as well as for a more general distribution of firm sizes.

As a novelty, this paper distinguishes between two different components of R&D: absorptive R&D and inventive R&D. It is demonstrated that a new effect appears: The absorptive-capacity effect now counteracts the free-rider effect of the traditional models. The findings show that firms will invest more in R&D to strengthen absorptive capacity when the spillover parameter is higher. To learn from its competitor, a firm needs to develop its absorptive capacity: no pain, no gain. (JEL O 31, L 13, C 72)

AB	A case study of copper interconnect technology suggests that absorptive capacity exist in three forms: disciplinary, domain specific and encoded. Each involves different ways of managing R&D and linking internal to external research. Disciplinary absorptive capacity requires a firm to actively engage with the scientific community, while protecting domain-specific knowledge. Domain-specific absorptive capacity depends upon influencing disciplinary research at universities and consortia, then capturing domain knowledge through collaboration and hiring. As technology develops, it becomes encoded, and absorption depends increasingly upon integrating knowledge from suppliers. Hence, absorptive capacity is a multifaceted construct that is heavily shaped by the type and maturity of technology absorbed.

AB	P>We merge research into knowledge management, absorptive capacity, and dynamic capabilities to arrive at an integrative perspective, which considers knowledge exploration, retention, and exploitation inside and outside a firm's boundaries. By complementing the concept of absorptive capacity, we advance towards a capability-based framework for open innovation processes. We identify the following six 'knowledge capacities' as a firm's critical capabilities of managing internal and external knowledge in open innovation processes: inventive, absorptive, transformative, connective, innovative, and desorptive capacity. 'Knowledge management capacity' is a dynamic capability, which reconfigures and realigns the knowledge capacities. It refers to a firm's ability to successfully manage its knowledge base over time. The concept may be regarded as a framework for open innovation, as a complement to absorptive capacity, and as a move towards understanding dynamic capabilities for managing knowledge. On this basis, it contributes to explaining interfirm heterogeneity in knowledge and alliance strategies, organizational boundaries, and innovation performance.

For the past two decades, the information technology (IT) industry has formed the backbone of Taiwan's economy. There are many theories that have identified a plethora of factors which contribute to the success of a small business. This case study applies the theory of absorptive capacity to ASUSTek Computer Inc., a small Taiwanese business founded on April 2, 1990 by four engineers with capital of NT$30 million (US$950,000) which has grown to become a global leader in the IT industry with a total revenue of NT$755 billion (US$24 billion) and market capitalization of NT$49 billion (US$1.5 billion) as of December 31, 2007. (Based on exchange rate US$1=NT$31.5. ASUS's revenue dropped to NT$668 billion in 2008 mainly due to the global financial crisis.) ASUS' business significantly took off after Jonney Shih joined the company as CEO in 1993. He remains a key anchor of ASUS. ASUS' ability to not only absorb, transform, and utilize new knowledge but develop new technology in-house to create and sustain competitive advantage in the market place has ensured the company's continuing success as well as propelling it to a position of leadership in the IT industry worldwide. This paper will discuss how ASUS' in-house RD; apprenticeship-style on-the-job training; management leadership's organizational culture and structureall of which stress learning and innovation; financial resources and conservative fiscal policy; as well as pro-business government policies have provided the foundation and environment for great absorptive capacity to develop and adapt technology, enabling ASUS to become a oGiant Liono in the global computer industry.

AB	Public sector information technology (IT) departments are facing a myriad of challenges (e.g., budget cuts, service expansions, and political turmoil) in addition to the constant and rapid technological changes facing private sector firms. One way to meet these challenges may be through the development of the organization's absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity refers to an organization's ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and use it to address organizational challenges associated with external change [6]. Few researchers have focused on absorptive capacity in public sector organizations. The purpose of this research is to ascertain how state IT departments, specifically Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and IT managers, view their external environment and their departments' ability to absorb new information.
The findings are derived from a national survey of state IT departments in the United States and indicate that for CIOs and IT managers the external environment and organizational culture are significant in predicting potential absorptive capacity. These variables are significant for the IT managers as a group, but for the CIOs as a group, only external environment is significant. These findings may be used by state IT management to increase the organization's ability to be aware of, identify, and take effective advantage of new knowledge and innovative technologies.

AB	Improved performance by public sector organizations is a political imperative in numerous countries. There are particular challenges in turnaround of poorly performing organizations. Theoretical explanations of the performance trajectories of public organizations, and especially the causes of failure, highlight the importance of knowledge processes, often from an organizational learning perspective. Absorptive capacity provides an alternative way of theorizing the relationships between organizational performance and knowledge processes, derived from the resource-based view of the firm and the broader concept of dynamic capabilities. The article reviews the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological implications of applying absorptive capacity to the performance of public organizations. It concludes that the approach has value and presents a number of propositions to be tested through empirical study, alongside some more general challenges for researchers who wish to study the concept further. The high political salience of public organizations' performance, and the costs of failure, mandates a major research effort on these issues.

Based on the literature, the concept of a knowledge sourcing strategy in alliance contexts is proposed, which can be categorised into two types: a knowledge internalisation strategy and a knowledge access strategy. From an organisational learning perspective, it is argued that a firm's absorptive capacity has a positive influence on a knowledge internalisation strategy, and accordingly a firm's choices of alliance forms are also influenced. RD performance is also included in the theoretical model in order to generate further managerial implications. Instead of using conventional regression methods, structural equation modelling (SEM) is adopted to conduct path analysis, as SEM is well suited in verifying multiple-dependent models. The arguments advanced are supported by empirical analysis of a sample of 148 alliances.

By testing five hypotheses, the research results find that absorptive capacity is the mediator between knowledge acquisition and innovation capability, and that knowledge acquisition has a positive effect on absorptive capacity. In addition, we used a multi-group approach and found that industry is a moderator between knowledge acquisition and innovation capability. Finally, a conclusion including research findings, discussion, implication, and future works is presented.

Drawing on survey data from a sample of 316 Dutch high-tech small firms, engaged in 1245 collaborations, we explore the relationship between R&D expenditure and distance to collaboration partners. In general terms, we find most partners to be 'local'. However, controlling for a variety of potential influences, higher R&D expenditure is positively related to collaboration with more distant organizations. The implications of our results for policy, practice and future research are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	The discussion on open innovation suggests that the ability to absorb external knowledge has become a major driver for competition. For R&D intensive large firms, the concept of open innovation in relation to absorptive capacity is relatively well understood. Little attention has: however, been paid to how both small firms and firms, which operate in traditional sectors, engage in open innovation activities. The latter two categories of firms often dispose of no, or at most a relatively low level of, absorptive capacity. Open innovation has two faces. In the case of inbound open innovation, companies screen their environment to search for technology and knowledge and do not exclusively rely on in-house R&D. A key pre-condition is that firms dispose of "absorptive capacity" to internalise external knowledge. SMEs and firms in traditional industries might need assistance in building absorptive capacity. This paper focuses on the role of collective research centres in building absorptive capacity at the inter-organisational level. In order to do so, primary data was collected through interviews with CEOs of these technology intermediaries and their member firms and analysed in combination with secondary data. The technology intermediaries discussed are created to help firms to take advantage of technological developments. The paper demonstrates that the openness of the innovation process forces firms lacking absorptive capacity to search for alternative ways to engage in inbound open innovation. The paper highlights the multiple activities of which absorptive capacity in intermediaries is made up; defines the concept of absorptive capacity as a pre-condition to open innovation; and demonstrates how firms lacking absorptive capacity collectively cope with distributed knowledge and innovation.

AB	The recent theories of innovation suggest that there is great potential for innovation in the structural holes and weak links of the innovation system. Higher absorptive capacity enables an easier crossing over of structural holes in the innovation system, aided by social capital that is located in the social relationships of actors. However, the level of human and social interaction in regional innovation systems has been largely neglected as a research topic. Empirical research on a sample in the Lahti region in Finland suggested three forms of social capital: organisational bonding social capital, regional bridging social capital and personal creative social capital. Further analysis revealed three groups of actors' interaction behaviour: Missionaries, House Mice and the Passive Resistance.

AB	Organizations' competitiveness and success are no longer dependent solely on their own performance, but rather are dependent on the competitiveness of the supply chains in which they participate. Increasingly, these supply chains are globally distributed introducing the possibility of greater benefits, as well as greater risk. This study examines the countervailing impact of a global supply chain partner's business-to-business e-commerce business risk and absorptive capacity on an organization's willingness to commit to and share information with that supply chain partner. We survey 207 organizations on their perceptions of specific offshore outsourcing and supply chain partners across dimensions of risk, absorptive capacity, commitment, and information sharing. The results support the theorized relationships indicating that a supply chain partner's increased levels of perceived risk has a strong negative effect on an organization's commitment and information sharing; conjointly, increases in a supply chain partner's absorptive capacity has a strong positive effect on commitment and information sharing. For both risk and absorptive capacity, commitment partially mediates the relationship with information sharing. Testing for systemic effects from geographical/cultural location on the relationship factors provides no evidence of a regional effect on measured items.

AB	This paper sheds light on factors influencing to what extent MNCs are able to implement a global environmental strategy. We apply the concept of absorptive capacity to analyze what role the uptake and integration of external knowledge plays in implementing an environmental strategy and propose to make a distinction between shared and unit-specific levels of absorptive capacity. Based on an in-depth investigation of the multinational chemical company BASF, we derive three propositions about the influence of absorptive capacity on the implementation of global environmental practices on the regional headquarters and subsidiary level. The main finding is that a shared level of absorptive capacity across subsidiaries facilitates a common understanding and use of environment-related knowledge, but, as environment-related knowledge often applies to a specific context only, there is also a need to build unit-specific absorptive capacity on a subsidiary level. By allowing subsidiaries to build their absorptive capacity, MNCs can more efficiently adapt global environmental practices and lower the cost of implementing a global environmental standard.

AB	Since its inception, the concept of absorptive capacity has been closely linked with notions of organizational learning. Yet the precise nature of the relationship between these two concepts has never been established. This relationship is examined in a variety of ways, and it is suggested that the literature on these two concepts shares a conceptual affinity which needs to be delineated. It is suggested that absorptive capacity (a dynamic capability) is a concrete example of organizational learning that concerns an organization's relationship with new external knowledge. Using the 4I Model for organizational learning (Crossan, M.M., Lane, H.W. and White, R.E. (1999). An organizational learning framework: from intuition to institution.

Absorptive capacity: a review, reconceptualization, and extension. Academy of Management Review, 27, 185-203), this paper proposes an integration of the two concepts.

Three main research questions are addressed: (1) what OI concepts are salient in their innovation portfolio?, (2) what OI concepts are used in the strategy formulation? and (3) what other concepts are present that augment OI? Interviews with 120 managers and archival documents were analyzed using thematic analysis. Two concepts prominent in the literature, (i) value capture models and (ii) technology evaluation criteria, were not present in this portfolio. By contrast, we found a focus on OI capability building, external information sharing and uncertain knowledge arbitrage in networks. Finally, we discuss these capabilities in relation to absorptive capacity, proposing a simple, but important bi-directional perspective to embrace OI.

AB	The processes for absorbing external knowledge become an essential element for innovation in firms and in adapting to changes in the competitive environment. Despite the huge growth in the absorptive capacity literature, a methodological gap still remains about a certain ambiguity in the definition of the construct specifying its theoretical domain and dimensionalization, and a lack of validation of the construct in most studies. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature on absorptive capacity through the creation and validation of two scales, justified with a thorough analysis of the literature, to measure the key components of the absorptive capacity construct: potential and realized absorptive capacities. The study includes confirmatory factor analysis on a sample of 952 Spanish firms to verify that the scales meet the psychometric properties the literature requires. The study results confirm the validity of the proposed scales and support their consolidation as a commonly used instrument with which to measure absorptive capacity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB	The purpose of this perspective paper is to advance understanding of absorptive capacity, its underlying dimensions, its multilevel antecedents, its impact on firm performance, and the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. Twenty years after the Cohen and Levinthal 1990 paper, the field is characterized by a wide array of theoretical perspectives and a wealth of empirical evidence. In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of absorptive capacity. Given the size and diversity of the absorptive capacity literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the absorptive capacity literature; and (3) the emergence of absorptive capacity from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational, and interorganizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of absorptive capacity as well as the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity. We argue that realizing the potential of the absorptive capacity concept requires more research that shows how "micro-antecedents" and " macro-antecedents" influence future outcomes such as competitive advantage, innovation, and firm performance. In particular, we identify conceptual gaps that may guide future research to fully exploit the absorptive capacity concept in the organization field and to explore future fruitful extensions of the concept.

AB	In light of the trend towards open innovation, interorganizational technology transfer by means of alliances and licensing has often become a key component of open innovation processes. Inbound open innovation describes inward technology transfer, whereas outbound open innovation refers to outward technology transfer. Traditionally, inward technology transfer has received considerable attention because most practitioners and academics focus on technology recipient's absorptive capacity. In contrast, the role of the technology source has been relatively neglected. This article addresses the concept of desorptive capacity, which refers to a firm's ability to identify technology transfer opportunities and to transfer technology to the recipient. The notion of market knowledge in the concept of desorptive capacity deepens our understanding of many firms' managerial difficulties in implementing active technology transfer strategies. Thus, desorptive capacity enriches our understanding of the dynamics of outward technology transfer. It provides new insights into the success or failure of interorganizational technology transactions.

AB	Prior literature on foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers has mainly focused on how the presence of FDI affects the productivity of domestic firms. In this study, we advance the literature by examining the effect of the diversity of FDI country origins on the productivity of domestic firms. We propose that the diversity of FDI country origins can facilitate FDI spillovers by increasing the variety of technologies and management practices brought by foreign firms, to which domestic firms are exposed and that they can potentially utilize. Further, the extent to which domestic firms can utilize these technologies and practices depends upon their absorptive capacity. Using panel data on Chinese manufacturing firms during the period 1998-2003, our results support these propositions. We,find that the diversity of FDI country origins in an industry has a positive relationship with the productivity of domestic firms in the industry. This positive relationship is stronger when domestic firms are larger, and when the technology gap between FDI and the domestic firms is intermediate. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB	The purpose of this study is to answer a call for the rejuvenation of the absorptive capacity (ACAP) construct by offering a novel conceptualization and empirical test of a multidimensional model of R&D project team ACAP that portrays it as a capability distinct from prior knowledge, specifies each dimension's level of analysis, distinguishes between individual and collective assimilation, and considers the moderating effects of team structure. Using a dataset from survey and archival sources on 100 innovations by R&D project teams, we find that the capability of R&D team members to evaluate external knowledge is related to their ability to assimilate it and that both individual assimilation capabilities and collective assimilation capabilities, in the form of ability to reach a shared understanding, are important to the team's ability to apply external knowledge. We also find that prior knowledge negatively moderates the relationship between individual assimilation and application ability and that team autonomy positively moderates this relationship. By clarifying levels of analysis and encompassing multiple dimensions of ACAP, this work leads to a more fine-grained understanding of the complex nature of ACAP. Implications of these findings for future research and R&D team management are presented.

AB	The increasing emphasis on academic entrepreneurship, technology transfer and research commercialisation within UK universities is predicated on basic research being developed by academics into commercial entities such as university spin-off companies or licensing arrangements. However, this process is fraught with challenges and risks, given the degree of uncertainty regarding future returns. In an attempt to minimise such risks, the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) process has been developed within University Science Park Incubators (USIs) to test the technological, business and market potential of embryonic technology. The key or the pivotal stakeholder within the PoC is the Principal Investigator (PI), who is usually the lead academic responsible for the embryonic technology. Within the current literature, there appears to be a lack of research pertaining to the role of the PI in the PoC process. Moreover, Absorptive Capacity (ACAP) has emerged within the literature as a theoretical framework or lens for exploring the development and application of new knowledge and technology, where the USI is the organisation considered in the current study. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the role and influence of the PI in the PoC process within a USI setting using an ACAP perspective. The research involved a multiple case analysis of PoC applications within a UK university USI. The results demonstrate the role of the PI in developing practices and routines within the PoC process. These practices and processes were initially tacit and informal in nature but became more explicit and formal over time so that knowledge was retained within the USI after the PIs had completed the PoC process.

AB	Effective knowledge management is important to the success of information technology projects. This research applies the integrated lens of the absorptive capacity theory and the social process model of information system development projects to examine the dynamic of knowledge activities concerning broadband infrastructure development in the context of municipal broadband networks. The research questions are: (1) What is the extent of the dynamic of knowledge activities involved in the development process?, (2) What are the events that trigger knowledge activities in municipal broadband development?, and (3) How does a city create and utilize new knowledge in the development process? This study examines municipal wireless projects in three cities (Chaska, MN; Hermosa Beach, CA; and Fredericton, Canada). Events that trigger knowledge activities are assignment of personnel, physical system construction, performance problems, resistance, and reassignment of organizational roles. Four factors that influence knowledge activities and project performance are the dynamic of technology development, partnership commitments, limitation of external knowledge and learning-by-doing, and political dynamics. The study has policy implications for cities that are in the process of planning and deployment. A good project planning, user expectation management, systematic performance evaluation, a careful partner selection process, and the use of service level agreements are important to project success. In addition, cities need to take into consideration that the technology is not a plug and play technology and that considerable efforts are needed to integrate the technology with other solutions to deliver broadband services as well as to configure the system according to topologies, street conditions, buildings, density of trees, among others.

AB	Before the introduction of the economic reform process in the late 1980s, the Vietnamese economy was operating under a centrally planned system. The reform process resulted in the integration of Vietnam into the world economy, which led to significant increase in foreign investment. By making use of panel data on 22 manufacturing industries over the period 1995-2005, this article examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI)-generated spillovers on manufacturing sector growth in Vietnam. Unlike most existing studies, which are limited to considering the effect of FDI on economic growth, this article focuses on the impact of FDI-linked spillovers that take place through both horizontal and vertical linkages between domestic and foreign firms. The empirical results presented here suggest that FDI-generated spillovers have made a significant contribution to manufacturing sector growth in Vietnam through vertical-backward linkages. The positive impact of vertical-backward linkages on manufacturing sector growth is strengthened by the stock of human capital. Specifically, manufacturing industries with a larger stock of human capital have experienced a higher level of technological advancement and hence stronger economic growth.

We find that backward-looking credit limit constraints imposed by banks make it difficult for firms to borrow, despite readily available bank liquidity, healthy aggregate demand, and a sharply falling cost of capital. The resulting aggregate failure to extend and retain capital in the economy suggests that agency costs that force banks to rely on sticky balance-sheet-based credit limits prevent emerging economies from effectively intermediating capital.

AB	This article analyses the case of a successful young high technology cluster in an old industrialized European region, the electronics and information and communications technology cluster in the Basque Country (Spain). Based on the findings of this case study, we propose that social capital and internationalization play an important role in increasing the absorptive capacity of clusters (thus, the capacity of a cluster to absorb, diffuse and creatively exploit extra-cluster knowledge), and hence, in sustaining their growth and dynamism. Absorptive capacity depends on the capacity of firms to establish intra-and extra-cluster knowledge linkages. We put forward in this article the fact that social capital fosters intra-cluster knowledge linkages, and cluster's internationalization the extra-cluster knowledge ones. Therefore, social capital and internationalization are key elements to increase the absorptive capacity of a cluster and its growth. Given the accumulative, path-and place-dependent nature of social capital and knowledge creation and accumulation, we employed a largely qualitative and historical analysis, combining statistical and qualitative cluster data and interviews with key actors.

AB	We investigate the intra-organizational antecedents of firm-level absorptive capacity (AC). Specifically, we examine how the functional areas of R&D, manufacturing and marketing contribute to the absorption of knowledge coming from different external knowledge sources. The econometric results on a representative sample of Swiss firms show that non-R&D-based AC plays a significantly different role compared to the standard R&D-based one that is typically considered in studies on AC. We also reveal that AC is organized through a specialization of external knowledge absorption across functional areas. In particular, we find: (1) R&D is particularly important as an absorber of knowledge from public research organizations for product innovation; (2) manufacturing is important as an absorber of supplier knowledge for product innovation and of competitor knowledge for process innovation; and (3) marketing helps to absorb customer knowledge for product and process innovation as well as competitor knowledge for product innovation. We further investigate the differences between product and process innovation and find that marketing-based AC is more important for the former, although the overall analysis of these differences is less conclusive. In short, we show how functional areas play a role in the organization of AC and that firms may need an ambidextrous strategy to innovate effectively based on both upstream-and downstream-based AC.

AB	Organisations are finding it increasingly more difficult to keep abreast with the pace of change. The continuous rise in the number of business opportunities and the increase in global competition require firms to combine internal and external learning processes to renew and reconfigure existing capabilities and knowledge to enable them to meet environmental demands and to innovate. This study aims to unravel the complex linkage between internal learning capacity and absorptive capacity and at exploring the joint effect of both knowledge generation processes on innovation capacity. This study also proposes innovation capacity as an antecedent of business performance. Using data from 952 industrial Spanish firms and the technique of structural equation modelling, we provide evidence on the joint effect of internal learning capacity and absorptive capacity on innovation capacity. We also show that innovation capacity acts as a catalyst for the effect of learning capacities on business performance.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to unravel the complex linkages between properties of knowledge, firm's absorptive capacities, and innovation performance in China small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Design/methodology/approach - The authors utilize moderated multiple regression (MMR) to explore the complex relationships by using the empirical data of Chinese information technology and electro-communication firms during 2005-2008.
Findings - The results show that only a few knowledge properties have negative effects on innovation performance. Most knowledge properties have a positive effect on innovation. The results also claim that the relationship between properties of knowledge and innovation performance is more pronounced when the firm has higher absorptive capacity
Originality/value - The study indicates that properties of knowledge and absorptive capacity are two inseparable determinants for innovation performance, and absorptive capacity moderates the relationship between properties of knowledge and innovation performance.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss whether the three knowledge sources, knowledge input, knowledge spillover and knowledge absorptive capacity really increase the innovation performance of firms in the Taiwan IC design industry, one of the most important knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) industries in Taiwan.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on the knowledge-based theory, this study uses pooled regression analysis and tests with fixed effect model to analyze the influence of three knowledge sources on innovation performance in the KIBS sector.
Findings - The results demonstrate that: knowledge input is positively related to innovation performance; knowledge spillover effect is partial positively to innovation performance; and knowledge absorptive capacity is positively related to innovation performance.
Originality/value - The paper advances the concept of absorptive capacity by defining it as the interactions between knowledge input and knowledge spillover and refines the measurement of absorptive capacity as the multiplication of knowledge input and knowledge spillover effects. Moreover, knowledge spillover effects and knowledge absorptive capacity are both divided into four kinds which help us distinguish clearly different sources of knowledge spillover and absorptive capacity In addition to that, this study also contributes to the empirical evidence to innovation activities by using firm-level micro data.

AB	The objective of this paper is to deepen our understanding of the role of absorptive capacity in enabling interorganizational new product development (INPD). We contend that despite what is known about the benefits of absorptive capacity to innovating firms, this research is dominated by firm-level analyses using cross-sectional data. The accumulated knowledge about absorptive capacity thus does not help with understanding how absorptive capacity unfolds as a process within and between firms such as when firms collaborate in new product development. Using a longitudinal case study, we build new theory at the INPD system level of analysis that leads us to shed new light on the cross-level interactions between firm- and alliance-level absorptive capacities.

AB	As suppliers take on more important roles in manufacturing and designing products, their operational innovativeness becomes an important source of value. We use the relational view theory to hypothesize for a positive association between operational innovativeness of established suppliers and manufacturer performance. Furthermore, we posit that the manufacturer can enhance this value by ensuring that the supplier is performing as expected (i.e., through supplier evaluation programs), and by focusing on learning from the supplier (i.e., through absorptive capacity). We then develop hypotheses as to how the influence of these two approaches differs when working with suppliers assigned to different types of tasks. We test the hypotheses using survey responses from 136 manufacturers evaluating 272 of their suppliers. Results show that supplier evaluation programs and absorptive capacity are both effective means of augmenting the benefits of supplier operational innovativeness. Contrary to theoretical predictions, benefits of operational innovativeness of suppliers with knowledge-intensive tasks are enhanced through increased absorptive capacity and through increased supplier evaluation programs.

AB	Purpose - The main objective of this study is as follows: while "knowledge acquisition in international joint ventures (IJVs)" has been widely in the limelight, the question of whether learning mechanisms in IJVs with Western vs Japanese parents are different has not yet been answered. In order to fill the current gap in the literature, this research seeks to answer the question by focusing on the absorptive capacity perspective.
Design/methodology/approach - The data were obtained by survey. A total of 1,207 questionnaires were posted to the CEOs of IJVs in Korea and 288 were returned, 42 of which were unusable, thus giving a response rate of 20.38 percent.
Findings - By using OLS regressions, two key findings are reported. First, the importance of absorptive capacity of IJVs in order to acquire foreign technology from parent firms is confirmed. Second, the results indicate that IJVs with Japanese multinational firms do not show different patterns of technology acquisition compared with IJVs with Western firms. Based on the findings, it is concluded that the learning mechanisms facilitating technology acquisition in IJVs is not highly influenced by foreign origins.
Originality/value - To reiterate, "knowledge acquisition in IJVs" has been widely in the limelight. However, no one has empirically analyzed the distinctions in learning mechanisms in IJVs with Western vs Japanese parents. This research contributes to the current literature by confirming the minimal substantial difference between them.

AB	The 20 years following the introduction of the seminal construct of absorptive capacity (AC) by Cohen and Levinthal (Cohen, W. M., D. A. Levinthal. 1989. Innovation and learning: The two faces of R&D. Econom. J. 99(397) 569-596; Cohen, W. M., D. A. Levinthal. 1990. Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation. Admin. Sci. Quart. 35(1) 128-152) have seen the proliferation of a vast literature citing the AC construct in over 10,000 published papers, chapters, and books, and interpreting it or applying it in many areas of organization science research, including organization theory, strategic management, and economics. However, with very few exceptions, the specific organizational routines and processes that constitute AC capabilities remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a routine-based model of AC as a first step toward the operationalization of the AC construct. Our intent is to direct attention to the importance of balancing internal knowledge creating processes with the identification, acquisition, and assimilation of new knowledge originating in the external environment. We decompose the construct of AC into two components, internal and external AC capabilities, and identify the configuration of metaroutines underlying these two components. These higher-level routines are expressed within organizations by configurations of empirically observable practiced routines that are idiosyncratic and firm specific. Therefore, we conceptualize metaroutines as the foundations of practiced routines. The ability of organizations to discover and implement complementarities between AC routines may explain why some firms are successful early adopters and most firms are imitators. Success as an early adopter of a new management practice or an innovation is expected to depend on the extent to which an organization evolves, adapts, and implements the configuration of its internal and external absorptive capacity routines.

Results confirm that the main effect of knowledge diversity on firm growth is not significant and it indeed plays a role of a moderator. The theory of absorptive capacity provides a good explanation that for firms with high knowledge diversity, strategic alliances and acquisitions are more effective while for firms with low knowledge diversity, internal RD investment is more effective. These findings point to an important research direct that the characteristics of a firm's knowledge portfolio play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of knowledge sourcing as well as interfirm partnership strategies.

AB	The discussion on open innovation suggests that the ability to absorb external knowledge has become a major driver for competition. For R&D intensive large firms, the concept of open innovation in relation to absorptive capacity is relatively well understood. Little attention has; however, been paid to how both small firms and firms, which operate in traditional sectors, engage in open innovation activities. The latter two categories of firms often dispose of no, or at most a relatively low level of, absorptive capacity. Open innovation has two faces. In the case of inbound open innovation, companies screen their environment to search for technology and knowledge and do not exclusively rely on in-house R&D. A key pre-condition is that firms dispose of "absorptive capacity" to internalise external knowledge. SMEs and firms in traditional industries might need assistance in building absorptive capacity. This paper focuses on the role of collective research centres in building absorptive capacity at the inter-organisational level. In order to do so, primary data was collected through interviews with CEOs of these technology intermediaries and their member firms and analysed in combination with secondary data. The technology intermediaries discussed are created to help firms to take advantage of technological developments. The paper demonstrates that the openness of the innovation process forces firms lacking absorptive capacity to search for alternative ways to engage in inbound open innovation. The paper highlights the multiple activities of which absorptive capacity in intermediaries is made up; defines the concept of absorptive capacity as a pre-condition to open innovation; and demonstrates how firms lacking absorptive capacity collectively cope with distributed knowledge and innovation.

This research studies to what extent the absorptive capacity of a firm influences its capacity to exploit new opportunities through new products, particularly in a specific context of industrial districts. A multidimensional approach to the absorptive capacity concept is used to distinguish between identification, assimilation, and exploitation of external knowledge. The population of companies belonging to a Spanish textile district is studied. Findings suggest that information and knowledge that a company receives from external sources provide the company with the necessary abilities to innovate. In the present case, the greater the absorptive capacity, the greater the innovation capacity for the company. [image omitted] Exposito-Langa M., Molina-Morales F. X. et Capo-Vicedo J.

AB	Scholars researching innovation are unanimous about the huge innovation potential in combining different fields of knowledge. Structural holes in innovation networks are especially fruitful in fostering new ideas and innovations. One problem in utilizing the innovation potential in structural holes stems from diversity or "distance" between the innovating partners. This study focuses on the concepts of distances, proximities, absorptive capacity and knowledge brokerage in relation to innovativeness in regional innovation networks. Knowledge brokers' own perceptions concerning their functions and roles in innovation policy are investigated by means of a case analysis of Lahti region in Finland. This study uses the experiences of the knowledge brokers to answer the question of how regional innovativeness could be skilfully enhanced by brokerage functions-in particular, by utilizing distances and proximities. As a result of this study, five central roles are defined for knowledge brokers. Knowledge brokers' roles and functions are demanding as recognized by the brokers themselves. Successful brokerage and the related improvement of absorptive capacity require a holistic approach to entire innovation processes and their wider environment.

AB	Knowledge spillovers are an important source of economic growth. In this study, we identify a mechanism through which knowledge spillovers occur among plants in the Chilean manufacturing industry. A plant-level production function is estimated with the absorptive-capacity hypothesis, that is, employment of skilled workers is a key channel through which knowledge is transmitted across plants. Results show that a plant's productivity from spillovers increases with its skill intensity, which is measured by the share of skilled workers in total employment. We also find that plants in a region with a large knowledge stock increase their skill intensity to benefit more from spillovers. Our results suggest that an increase in regional knowledge stock is the most effective policy to improve a plant's productivity. However, policies that encourage a plant to employ high skill-intensive production also enhance its productivity.

We bring together data collected from a survey of UK firms that collaborated with universities, and firm-level data on past partnerships with universities. The results show that benefits from interactions with universities are multifaceted, including enhancement of the firm's explorative and exploitative capabilities. Results also indicate that firms' R&D commitments, geographical proximity to and research quality of university partners have a distinct impact on the different types of benefits from interactions with universities. We find geographical proximity is crucial for assessing problem-solving as an important benefit, while interactions with top quality universities have a positive influence on the benefits associated with firms' downstream activities. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From a dataset of 952 Spanish firms and 35 industrial districts, we provide empirical evidence that industrial districts are spaces with dense networks of information and knowledge transfer, inter-personnel relationships and a strong specialised stock of human capital, which are accessible and shared by all firms embedded in such a district. However, we explain the complementarity between district and firm-specific capacities in order to develop the notion of absorptive capacity, by indicating that the diffusion of shared competences is neither easy nor direct and that it requires a firm's internal learning effort to better absorb localised knowledge spillovers. Results enable us to shed new light on how firms' knowledge creation and diffusion processes benefit from these external knowledge flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using a sample of 121 emerging multinational corporations (EMNCs) from China, we explore the effects of managerial ties with government officials and foreign MNC partners on knowledge acquisition and investigate how the acquired knowledge affects firms' new product market performance. Our results indicate that knowledge acquisition could only enhance new product market performance with the presence of realized absorptive capacity.

Even though Cohen and Levinthal's work (1990) highlights the multidimensionality of ACAP, researchers have measured it as a uni-dimensional construct, often using a firm's R&D spending intensity as a proxy for this construct. This practice raises questions about the veracity of the claims made in the literature about the nature and contributions of ACAP. The present study develops and validates a multidimensional measure of ACAP, building on relevant prior literature, a series of pre-tests, and two large survey-based studies of German companies.

Thus, no measurement instrument can be adapted to these dimensions. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature on absorptive capacity by using a resource-based view to present an alternative measurement instrument for absorptive capacity. This instrument differentiates between the phases of acquisition. assimilation, transformation and exploitation of knowledge, as well as between the two dimensions of absorptive capacity (potential and realized), to reduce the problem of measuring and identifying the dimensions that shape this important construct. The instrument's validity and reliability are guaranteed and have been tested using data from 168 Spanish organizations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB	To understand how firms facing technological discontinuities utilize knowledge from alliance portfolios, we unpack absorptive capacity into "latitudinal" and "longitudinal" components, corresponding to use of diverse and distant knowledge, respectively. We find that a moderate burden on firms' latitudinal absorptive capacity, corresponding to medium diversity in their portfolios, contributes to optimal knowledge utilization. Simultaneously increasing the demand on firms' longitudinal absorptive capacity affects this relationship negatively. Highlighting important trade-offs between latitudinal and longitudinal absorptive capacities, our findings reveal two portfolio strategies, "telescopic" and "panoptic" searches, that optimize knowledge utilization. We address important dialectics concerning absorptive capacity constraints and knowledge utilization.

AB	This paper examines the pattern of innovation and learning among state-owned enterprises in Chinese high-tech sectors and empirically estimates the impact of three types of investment for acquiring technological knowledge-in-house R&D, importing foreign technology, and purchasing domestic technology-on the innovation capabilities of firms. Based on a panel dataset consisting of 21 high-tech sectors during the period 1995-2004, an augmented knowledge production function is estimated. The results show that importing foreign technology alone does not facilitate innovation in Chinese state-owned high-tech enterprises, unless in-house R&D is also conducted. Domestic technology purchases, however, are found to have a favorable direct impact on innovation, suggesting that firms have less difficulty in absorbing domestic technological knowledge than utilizing foreign technology and that absorptive capacity is contingent upon the source or nature of the external knowledge.

AB	Absorptive capacity (ACAP) is a firm's ability to innovate by identifying, assimilating, and exploiting knowledge available in its environment. ACAP has been widely researched, but this research has not sufficiently analyzed the influence of ACAP on an interfirm level, especially regarding the multidimensional character of this construct. The present study intends to reveal whether the relationship between ACAP and firm performance in small and mediun sized enterprises (SMEs) is mediated by strategic alliances. Furthermore, different moderating characteristics such as age and size of the companies are taken into consideration. The findings indicate that strategic alliances of SMEs mediate both the relationship between ACAP and firm performance and the relationship between each dimension of ACAP and firm performance. However, these results might not be valid under certain circumstances since strategic alliances have no mediating influence when it comes to young SMEs, for example.

This study provides an in-depth explanation of the key mechanisms that interlace the different learning processes leading to innovations in a relational context. A theoretical elaboration of these mechanisms precedes their empirical study within four customer-supplier dyads, centred on two focal customer organizations. The article contributes by discussing how the mechanisms act and interact to create absorptive capacity for a focal firm across relationships. We find that structural learning mechanisms, while necessary are not sufficient to explain variation in the presence of absorptive capacity across different learning contexts. Cultural, psychological and policy learning mechanisms complement the picture. From the empirical analysis we derive propositions to guide further research into the creation of absorptive capacity in a relational context.

AB	Standard innovation surveys do not consider incoming spillovers for non-innovative firms. As a consequence, empirical works may overestimate the absorptive capacity effect, particularly among competitors. The Swiss innovation surveys presented here measure the importance of knowledge for both innovating and non-innovating firms. This original feature enables us to show that knowledge from rivals actually deters manufacturing firms from engaging in R&D activities. We therefore provide stronger evidence that the efficiency effect due to intra-industry spillovers is larger than that generally estimated by data from standard surveys. The R&D based absorptive capacity is weaker than expected, and non-innovative firms as well as non-R&D firms heavily rely on their rivals' knowledge to maintain their technological capacities.

AB	Against a background of increasing international competition and rapid technological change, universities and industry have often engaged in collaboration as a means of improving cross-unit transfers of the resources, capabilities, and knowledge. Following this frontier, this study examines the effects of university and firm interpartner resource alignment and absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance from the university-industry (U-I) perspective. Regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 120 Taiwanese firms. The research findings suggest that, interpartner resource utilization is positively related to U-I interaction; that when the effect of a firm's absorptive capacity is higher, U-I interaction is more favorable; and that U-I interaction is positively related to knowledge transfer performance. Our empirical results support the process-oriented view and indicate that U-I interaction plays the mediating role between resource alignment, absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer performance. The implications of this study are two-fold. First, it emphasizes the value of creative financial and general performance in knowledge transfer by incorporating the U-I interaction perspective. Second, the research results offer support for suggestions that interpartner resource alignment provides a necessary element for capacity and resource exchange. Hence, one interesting further research would analyze practical cases of some Taiwanese companies with the described approach. This is an important practical issue that should be examined in the future.

AB	The strategic importance of business-to-business (B2B) relationships is well recognized, but their financial impact remains equivocal. This study links social capital from three types of B2B networks of young technology firms with their initial public offering (IPO) value. The authors identify three relevant types of absorptive capacity that facilitate the transformation of B2B social capital into IPO value. For the transformation to occur, the authors find that young firms need not only the opportunity to access the resources provided by B2B relationships but also the ability to leverage them through the complementary capability-namely, absorptive capacity. They test the hypotheses on a sample of 177 IPOs, and the results are robust to endogeneity concerns and alternative measures. As one of the first studies in marketing-finance interface to focus on young firms, the findings provide novel insights, such as the deleterious financial consequence of having marketing and research-and-development B2B relationships without the relevant absorptive capacity. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications regarding communicating the value of absorptive capacity, disclosure of marketing-related information, and the importance of marketing for young technology firms.

AB	Absorptive capacity is a firm's ability to value, assimilate, and utilize new external knowledge and apply it to commercial ends. Much of the prior research on absorptive capacity focuses on characterizing the factors that influence absorptive capacity within organizations. However, the mechanism of how related factors affect absorptive capacity across interdependent organizations in project networks remains less explored. This paper extends a simulation model of project network learning to explore the absorptive capacity of project networks where periodic external innovations exist. This model is utilized in a series of simulation experiments to untangle the effects of varying types of innovation and degrees of relational instability in a project network. We establish a measure of project network absorptive capacity and develop an argument that relational instability moderates the project network's absorptive capacity for different types of innovation. These findings have significant implications for assessing and developing strategies to improve a project organizational network's capacity to absorb and, hence, profit from innovation.

AB	The concept of absorptive capacity has already been considerably studied from a theoretical perspective, but few, if any, attempts at operationalizing the concept have been studied in ways that would allow its full assessment. The more specific focus provided by the four dimensions identified in some recent literature - acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation - opens up some promising avenues for operationalizing the concept. This exploratory research studies and describes case studies of ten innovative companies using a cross-sectional research design. In the first part of the article, we re-examine the concept of absorptive capacity in terms of dynamic capabilities and provide a review of the relevant literature. The second part describes the work accomplished to operationalize the concept of dynamic capability and analyses the possible relationship between the business strategies adopted by the companies studied and their particular strategic capacity.

AB	This paper systematically investigates the impacts of openness on regional innovation in China, especially the role of absorptive capacity in mediating the spillover effect brought about by openness. Based on provincial-level data over the period 1997-2007 and adopting patents as indicator of innovation, the empirical results show that the estimated patents - R&D elasticity is lower than that for OECD countries, while there is a significant R&D spillover effect across regions in China. Technology import overall has no significant influence on fostering innovations, but it is significantly positive for coastal regions. Openness to trade, in terms of FDI and high-tech product exports, is witnessed to exhibit a significantly positive impact on promoting regional innovation. Crucially, the effects of technology imports and FDI on innovations vary significantly between coastal and non-coastal regions. Using human capital as a proxy for absorptive capacity, we find it helps in learning external sources of knowledge and then contributes to innovations. Moreover, absorptive capacity is expected to play an important role in mediating the spillover effect brought about by openness to trade.

AB	We design a conceptual framework for linking two approaches: absorptive capacity and spatial Knowledge Spillovers (KSs). Regions produce new knowledge, but only part of it is efficiently adopted in the economy; the share of efficiently adopted technology depends on cognitive capital. Our dataset is based on a panel of European regions over the period 1999 to 2006, combining data from EUROSTAT and the European Values Study (EVS). We test the hypothesis that insufficient levels of cognitive capital hamper the capability of regions to fully exploit new knowledge. Results show that a lower regional absorptive capacity increases KS towards surrounding areas, hampering the regions' capability to decode and efficiently exploit new knowledge, both locally produced and originating from outside.

AB	Purpose - Absorbing knowledge from partner firms is a key feature of marketing relationships. Recent publications have called for more dynamic and cognitive approaches in marketing relationship research. Also, established definitions of absorptive capacities have been questioned. This article aims to address propositions that take these overlooked and questioned elements into consideration, which can help explain conducts and dependencies, and affect relationship durability.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors put forward four propositions by combining literature on interfirm relationships and managerial cognition with evolutionary ideas from marketing and management literature.
Findings - The authors embrace a redefinition of potential absorptive capacity (the disposed capacity to absorb knowledge) and realized absorptive capacity (the absorption of knowledge actually performed). This distinction can, to some extent, be explained by the degree of cognitive attention given to the marketing relationship. Moreover, asymmetrically realized absorptive capacity vis-a-vis a partner substantially influences the dynamics of partners' conduct and dependency, which may vary the risk that the relationship will end.
Practical implications - The propositions illustrate how a motivated partner that gives more attention to the relationship is more likely to absorb more knowledge than its counterpart, which can threaten the durability of a relationship. Thus, managers need to be able to understand possible long-term consequences of the partner's conduct in order to avoid losses of joint strategic resources and relational benefits.
Originality/value - By advocating an evolutionary approach, an impetus for more dynamism in marketing relationship research is presented. This study also shows the importance of including the longitudinal dimension in analysis if one wants to understand change in - and durability of - marketing relationships.

AB	The importance of the six sigma methodology in industry is growing constantly. However, there are few empirical studies that analyse the advantages of this methodology and its positive effects on organisational performance. The purpose of this paper is to extend understanding of the success of six sigma quality management initiatives by investigating the effects of six sigma teamwork and process management on absorptive capacity. It also seeks to understand the relation between absorptive capacity and organisational learning as two sources of sustainable competitive advantage. The information used comes from a larger study, the data for which was collected from a random sample of 237 European firms. Of these 237 organisations, 58 are six sigma organisations. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The main findings show that six sigma teamwork and process management positively affect the development of absorptive capacity. A positive and significant relationship is also observed between absorptive capacity and organisational learning orientation. The findings of this study justify six sigma implementation in firms. This study provides us with an in-depth understanding of some structural elements that characterise the six sigma methodology, enabling us to provide an explanation for its success.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses structural equation modelling of survey data from 218 Canadian manufacturers referring to a particular relationship with one of their customers.
Findings - Results suggest that only the first dimension of the relative absorptive capacity - knowledge sharing routines - influences the knowledge transferred from the customer to the supplier. Knowledge transfer acts as a mediator between knowledge sharing routines and the supplier's operational performance improvement.
Research limitations/implications - The absence of a significant association between the second dimension of relative absorptive capacity - overlapped knowledge bases - and knowledge transfer is a surprising result that should be further investigated.
Originality/value - This appears to be the first study to operationalise and empirically test relative absorptive capacity and its consequences in the particular context of customer-supplier relationships.

AB	The Spanish healthcare system has undergone important changes, particularly in the development of new homecare services. In practice, however, results have been mixed. Some homecare services have been successful, but implementation failures are common and the intended patients are frequently reluctant to use the homecare services. A possible explanation for efficiency and effectiveness gaps of services provided by hospital-in-the-home units (HHUs) may relate to the advantages and disadvantages of the knowledge processes that these units highlight as a result of their different structural properties. This study examines the impact of an unlearning (forgetting) context on the HHU's ability to challenge basic beliefs and to implement processes that are explicitly or tacitly helpful in the reception of new ideas (absorptive capacity). These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 54 doctors and 62 nurses belonging to 44 HHUs. The results show that the unlearning context plays a key role in managing the tension between potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity.

AB	This paper analyses how the internal resources of small-and medium-sized enterprises determine access (learning processes) to technology centres (TCs) or industrial research institutes (innovation infrastructure) in traditional low-tech clusters. These interactions basically represent traded (market-based) transactions, which constitute important sources of knowledge in clusters. The paper addresses the role of TCs in low-tech clusters, and uses semi-structured interviews with 80 firms in a manufacturing cluster. The results point out that producer-user interactions are the most frequent; thus, the higher the sector knowledge-intensive base, the more likely the utilization of the available research infrastructure becomes. Conversely, the sectors with less knowledge-intensive structures, i.e. less absorptive capacity (AC), present weak linkages to TCs, as they frequently prefer to interact with suppliers, who act as transceivers of knowledge. Therefore, not all the firms in a cluster can fully exploit the available research infrastructure, and their AC moderates this engagement. In addition, the existence of TCs is not sufficient since the active role of a firm's search strategies to undertake interactions and conduct openness to available sources of knowledge is also needed. The study has implications for policymakers and academia.

AB	Purpose - Recent research and practice have put a great deal of effort into finding efficient ways of managing and organizing to promote innovation within organizations. This study aims to continue this trend in addressing issues related to knowledge transfer and protection through examining roles of absorptive capacity and appropriability regimes and the interplay between them. An appropriability regime can play a dual role when external knowledge and the knowledge-base of the firm form the basis for absorptive capacity, which then contributes to innovation performance.
Design/methodology/approach - The study provides an empirical examination of the direct and moderating roles of appropriability regime regarding the above-mentioned dual role. Data collected from 335 firms was utilized to perform regression analyses.
Findings - The empirical evidence suggests, first, that the strength of the appropriability regime has a positive effect on absorptive capacity (especially the acquisition of knowledge) together with good connectedness to external knowledge sources and high levels of internal R&D. In addition, support can be found for the idea of absorptive capacity and the appropriability regime being positively related to innovation performance. Both direct and moderating effects can be found, but they are slightly different for knowledge acquisition and application.
Originality/value - This study contributes to prior studies by producing empirical evidence on the relationships described above. An important issue is also that it departs from prior works by viewing an appropriability regime as a factor that can be affected by the firm (i.e. as a strategic tool), and not as a purely environmental or external factor.

AB	The current paper focuses on absorptive capacity in the context of strategic innovation. Strategic innovation aims at a re-conceptualisation of business models, the creation of uncontested market spaces, and leaps in customer value. By using the learning-process perspective of absorptive capacity (exploratory, assimilative, transformative, and exploitative learning processes), we suggest that transformative learning processes in particular, play a key role in strategic innovation. In addition, a follower strategy and participative role in the knowledge network, instead of a first-mover strategy and a dominant role in the knowledge network, do indeed promote strategic innovation. Companies should not only manage the accumulation of external knowledge, but also adapt their combinative capabilities (systematisation, coordination, and socialisation of knowledge) in order to succeed with strategic innovation. The findings yield a set of research propositions for further academic and managerial consideration. Two longitudinal case studies of European electricity providers form the empirical background.

AB	Absorptive capacity is an important organizational capability constituted by exploratory, transformative, and exploitative learning processes. Leadership has been shown to affect such processes, but little is known about how the combined leadership styles of top and middle management influence absorptive capacity. This theory-building, exploratory qualitative case study discusses the need for top and middle management to be ambidextrous and to change their styles to better facilitate the three different learning processes. We found that an exploratory learning process was facilitated when both top and middle management used a transformational style, a transformative learning process was facilitated when top management used a transformational style while middle management used a transactional style, and an exploitative learning process was facilitated when both top and middle management used a transactional style. Furthermore, for each of the three learning processes, the leadership styles of top and middle management operated more effectively when certain attributes of the organizational context were emphasized.

We also examine the relationship between absorptive capacity and the existence and enhancement of innovativeness. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 286 large Spanish companies. Our results show that absorptive capacity is an important dynamic determinant for developing a company's innovativeness. Moreover, this relationship is best explained by two related constructs. First, the company's unlearning context is a crucial determinant for both potential capacity and realized absorptive capacity. Second, the results also indicate a tangible means for managers to enhance their absorptive capacity through information systems capabilities.

AB	A large body of research investigates how manufacturing flexibility in uncertain environments leads to firm performance, with mixed results. The mixed findings could be due to differences across firms in terms of the capabilities to acquire, assimilate, and transform knowledge and to simultaneously pursue both the exploitation of existing operational capabilities and the exploration for new operational capabilities. Building on the literature that suggests that manufacturing flexibility mediates the relationship between environmental uncertainty and firm performance, we explore the applicability of two organizational learning contingencies to the operations environment: operational absorptive capability and operational ambidexterity. Absorptive capacity enables the recognition and assimilation of new knowledge. Ambidexterity determines whether this knowledge will be applied for both exploration and exploitation. Using a sample of 852 manufacturing firms, we find that environmental uncertainty affects firm performance directly and indirectly through manufacturing flexibility. Furthermore, both operational absorptive capacity and operational ambidexterity moderate the relationship between environmental uncertainty and manufacturing flexibility and the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and firm performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	Despite the diffusion of communication tools and boundary spanning technologies, knowledge flows in innovation processes retain a distinct localized nature in many industries, and geographical clusters emerge as critical areas to foster technological diffusion. In this article, we focus on the knowledge mediating role, as technological "gatekeepers," of focal firms in industrial districts. Based on a longitudinal dataset of 720 patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1990 and 2003 to firms in the automatic packaging machinery industrial district in Northern Italy, and controlling for the uneven geographical distribution of patenting activities, we show that: (i) firms within the district use local knowledge to a greater extent and more rapidly than knowledge from outside the district, (ii) focal firms use external knowledge to a greater extent than other firms operating in the district, and (iii) other (nonfocal) firms within the district rely on knowledge generated by focal firms to a greater extent than would be expected, given the geographic distribution of innovative activity in the industry. Implications for research on innovation in localized economic systems and firm-level strategic differentiation are discussed.

AB	To assist with progress towards the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in developing countries, the international community is scaling-up foreign aid to record levels. Concurrently, there are concerns that additional aid will not be used effectively due to a problem of absorptive capacity in recipient countries. Empirical studies lend support to these concerns with many finding that there are diminishing returns to foreign aid. This paper reviews the extensive aid effectiveness literature to identify the various dimensions of absorptive capacity. It proceeds by devising a composite index of absorptive capacity for individual recipient countries which can assist policymakers in guiding the allocation of their aid. The relevance of the index is confirmed through its employment in a standard empirical model of aid effectiveness. The paper highlights the developing countries that currently receive high levels of aid relative to their estimated level of absorptive capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	In this work we explore the role of interfirm R&D alliances as a vital mechanism for creating new technological knowledge. Drawing on the absorptive capacity perspective, we argue that firms with a high level of such capacity seem to benefit more from their alliances. Specifically, three indicators of technology strategy relevant to absorptive capacity, including proportion of R&D alliances in an alliance portfolio, technological distance, and R&D intensity are explored to examine their impacts on innovation performance. Using alliance data from the Securities Data Company (SDC), patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), firm data from S&P COMPUSTAT, and co-patents granted as a proxy for the alliance innovation performance, these results show that while alliance networks potentially provide a firm with access to various benefits that can help in creating new technologies, R&D alliances in particular are more suitable than other types of partnerships to achieve this aim. Furthermore, given that information transfer and learning are key benefits of R&D alliances, moderate technological distance is needed if such alliances are to be successful. In particular, the innovation performance peaks at the moderate level of technological distance with alliance partners when this interacts with the proportion of R&D alliances in a firm's alliance portfolio. Finally, R&D alliances should be regarded as a complement to rather than a substitute for a firm's internal R&D. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB	In this conceptual article, we extend earlier work on Open Innovation and Absorptive Capacity. We suggest that the literature on Absorptive Capacity does not place sufficient emphasis on distributed knowledge and learning or on the application of innovative knowledge. To accomplish physical transformations, organisations need specific Innovative Capacities that extend beyond knowledge management. Accessive Capacity is the ability to collect, sort and analyse knowledge from both internal and external sources. Adaptive Capacity is needed to ensure that new pieces of equipment are suitable for the organisation's own purposes even though they may have been originally developed for other uses. Integrative Capacity makes it possible for a new or modified piece of equipment to be fitted into an existing production process with a minimum of inessential and expensive adjustment elsewhere in the process. These Innovative Capacities are controlled and coordinated by Innovative Management Capacity, a higher-order dynamic capability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	The concept of absorptive capacity (ACAP) observing a firm's ability to value, assimilate and utilise new external knowledge is applied in this paper. This case study analysis focuses on the strategic management processes and competitiveness of the Cimber Sterling airline. The aim is to discover resources and capabilities that lead to competitive advantages within the aviation industry. From an ACAP perspective, Cimber Sterling Group A/S was analysed by interviewing selected owners, managers and employees of the airline. A comparison within the airline industry regarding external factors and the strategic management of other selected low-cost airlines is part of the ACAP concept. The analysis shows to what extent Cimber Sterling Group A/S, as a Danish family business, copes with increasing competition and critical situations, such as the recent volcanic ash cloud and the financial crisis. Identifying the potential and realised capacity of the strategic management of airlines was revealed as a source of strategic competitiveness. The ACAP was improved through stakeholder experience, strategic flexibility, networking capabilities and customer orientation, leading to a competitive advantage realisation in the low-cost airline market.

AB	Absorptive capacity is a firm's ability to identify assimilate, transform, and apply valuable external knowledge. iris considered an imperative for business success. Modern information technologies perform a critical role in the development and maintenance of a firm's absorptive capacity. We provide an assessment of absorptive capacity in the information systems literature. IS scholars have used the absorptive capacity construct in diverse and often contradictory ways. Confusion surrounds how absorptive capacity should be conceptualized, its appropriate level of analysis, and how it can be measured. Our aim in reviewing this construct is to reduce such confusion by improving our understanding of absorptive capacity and guiding its effective use in IS research. We trace the evolution of the absorptive capacity construct in the broader organizational literature and pay special attention to its conceptualization, assumptions, and relationship to organizational learning. Following this, we investigate how absorptive capacity has been conceptualized, measured, and used in IS research. We also examine how absorptive capacity fits into distinct IS themes and facilitates understanding of various IS phenomena. Based on our analysis, we provide a framework through which IS researchers can more fully leverage the rich aspects of absorptive capacity when investigating the role of information technology in organizations.

ID	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES, TECHNOLOGY
AB	This article offers a conceptual analysis of two aspects of openness: extended feedback and absorptive capacity in the context of a developing country national innovation system. Extended feedback is defined as the capacity of national agencies, responsible for telecentre development, to learn and share learning about the practices, ideas and information demands of people using their telecentres. This allows for a greater diffusion of knowledge across the national innovation system (NIS). Absorptive capacity is defined as the capacity of users to access and share information and apply it for productive practices. These concepts are used in this article to help explain the ways that social networks can be consolidated and extended, horizontally and vertically, through telecentres in rural Nepal and consequently contribute to social and economic development. The argument is developed that telecentres, providing there is extended feedback at the institutional level and absorptive capacity at both local and central levels, extend access to 'bridging social capital'. The paper concludes by identifying some potential indicators for monitoring and evaluating the impact of ICT (Information Communication Technologies) using these concepts.

AB	In this study, we theoretically identify three dimensions of expatriate competencies ability, motivation, and opportunity seeking for knowledge transfer. Integrating the ability-motivation-opportunity framework and the absorptive capacity perspective, we propose that expatriate competencies in knowledge transfer influence a subsidiary's performance through the knowledge received by the subsidiary, but that this indirect effect is stronger when subsidiary absorptive capacity is greater. We collected multi-source, time-lagged data from 162 British subsidiaries of Taiwanese multinational firms. The results support our hypotheses. Overall, we contribute to expatriation theory and research by revealing specific expatriate competencies as well as identifying boundary conditions for successful expatriate knowledge transfer.

AB	Inventors often experience a low productivity after their company has been subject to a merger or acquisition (M&As). It is of central managerial interest to identify factors facilitating the integration of new inventive staff and thereby counteracting innovation declines after M&As. This paper provides empirical evidence into the role of acquiring firms' absorptive capacity for the post-merger patent productivity of the acquired inventors. Based on a sample of 544 inventors employed by European acquisition targets in the period 2000-2001 it is shown that the post-merger productivity of acquired inventors is significantly higher within acquiring firms with a distinct absorptive capacity. It can be concluded that absorptive capacity is a firm capability that enhances the integration of inventors after firm takeovers.

The analysis is established in three phases, namely, the general publication, the subject area, and the topic profiling. The study obtains patterns, characteristics, and attributes at country, institutions, journals, author, and core reference levels. It shows the increase of the research activity in the field, based on the publication productivity during the years mentioned. Most of these publications are classified in the subject areas of business and economics, engineering, and operations research and management science. We highlight the nascent interest of the computer science subject area as a way to operationalize the different studies conducted. We found a lack of contribution from African and Latin-American countries despite the importance of the field for them. Our results are useful in terms of science strategy, science and technology policy, research agendas, research alliances, and research networks according to the special interest of specific actors at the individual, institutional, and national levels.

AB	Absorptive capacity is frequently highlighted as a key determinant of knowledge transfer within multinational enterprises. But how individual behaviour translates into absorptive capacity at the subsidiary level, and how this is contingent on subsidiaries' social context, remains under-addressed. This not only limits our understanding of the relationship between individual- and organizational-level absorptive capacity, but also hampers further research on potentially relevant managerial and organizational antecedents, and limits the implications we can draw for practitioners who seek to increase their organization's capacity to put new knowledge to use. To address this shortcoming we conduct an in-depth comparative case study of a headquarters-initiated knowledge transfer at two subsidiaries of the same multinational enterprise. The findings demonstrate that social interaction is a prerequisite for subsidiary absorptive capacity as it enables employees to participate in the transformation of new knowledge to the local context and the development of local applications. The findings also illustrate how organizational conditions at the subsidiary level can impact subsidiary absorptive capacity by enabling or constraining local interaction patterns. These insights contribute to the absorptive capacity literature by demonstrating the scale and scope of social interaction as a key link between individual- and organizational-level absorptive capacity.

AB	We examine how determinants of absorptive capacity influence learning in alliances over time. Using longitudinal patent cross-citation data, we find an inverted U-shaped pattern over time that is influenced by firm-level and relational factors. Technological similarity only modestly increases learning in the initial stages of a relationship, but moderate levels substantially increase knowledge flows later in the alliance. High technological diversity is related to higher initial learning rates, but the effects diminish over time. Somewhat surprisingly, research and development intensity is negatively related to initial learning rates but has a considerable positive effect later in the relationship. We suggest that initial learning rates in alliances may be constrained by the capacity to absorb knowledge, while later-stage outcomes are constrained by exploitation capacity.

AB	Whilst absorptive capacity has been identified as an important contributor to the effective implementation of IT systems, previous studies have failed to explicitly consider the contribution of individual and organizational knowledge processes. Nine case studies of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation were undertaken. The case studies were all undertaken in SMEs in a developing country since this is an important but under researched area for the application of the concept of absorptive capacity. A particular implication of the findings is that firms lacking knowledge of IT implementation cannot simply seek this from external sources but must develop internal organizational knowledge processes if their implementations of IT systems are to be effective. This finding is particularly pertinent to the developing country and SME context of this study, where low levels of experience within the firm and the loss of experienced staff are found to impact on the development of absorptive capacity.

AB	The relationship between innovation and product diversification in firms has been studied and debated for decades. Early articles proposed a positive relationship, while subsequent research supported a negative influence on innovation from product diversification based on observable reductions in research and development expenditures. Such findings also suggest a negative influence on absorptive capacity from increasing product diversification. This paper uses an absorptive capacity perspective to revisit the relationship. Together with related literature on knowledge creation and transfer processes, a positive association between related product diversification by firms and the quantity of created technological knowledge is suggested. Evidence to support such a relationship is provided using patent data from technology-based firms in a sample of 1997 firm years between 1990 and 2006. Some evidence of a negative association between knowledge creation and very high levels of unrelated diversification is indicated, qualifying and supporting the "M-form" hypothesis. The findings more closely align understandings of the relationship between product diversification and innovation with the relationship between product diversification and firm performance.

AB	There has been little systematic empirical literature on the linkage between income inequality and FDI (Basu and Guariglia, 2007; Tsai, 1995). This paper analyzes the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on income inequality and asks whether the relationship depends on absorptive capacity or not, by using a cross-sectional dataset taken from 54 countries over the period 1980-2005. We adopt the endogenous threshold regression model proposed by Hansen (2000) and Caner and Hansen (2004) and find strong evidence of a two-regime split in our sample. That is, FDI is likely to be harmful to the income distribution of those host countries with low levels of absorptive capacity. By contrast, our results support the perspective that FDI has little effect on income inequality in the case of countries with better absorptive capacity. It is also shown that international trade can lead to more equal income distribution. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	Building a complex portfolio of products can be beneficial for young firms due to increased sales growth and competitiveness. Yet, the benefits from product portfolio complexity (PPC) are often outweighed by rising costs, leading to an inverted U-shaped relationship between PPC and performance. Recent research has called for an increased understanding of how firms are able to better manage higher levels of PPC. We suggest that absorptive capacity and ambidexterity are vital to enhancing the benefits and mitigating the costs of increasing PPC. Using a sample of 215 young high technology firms, we find support for positive moderating effects of absorptive capacity and ambidexterity on the inverted U-shaped relationship between PPC and firm performance.

We therefore investigate how orchestration (rather than traditional management) of relationships by improving absorptive capacity, network stability, and innovation appropriability contribute to the success of both the network and the individual firm, from the firm's point of view. We use survey data collected from 213 R&D-intensive firms. The results indicate that diverging effects emerge regarding alliance and firm success; stability and absorptive capacity are most relevant for the former, and absorptive capacity and appropriability for the latter.

We investigate whether FDI is an effective channel of technological transfer across borders and whether that technology transfer is bi-directional: from an investing country to a host country and vice versa. In particular, an analysis is provided of whether FDI helps channel more resources towards the promotion of education activities and hence augments economic growth indirectly through augmenting the host country's absorptive capacity. Also, the analysis uses a novel approach to take into account the possibility that physical distances can act as a barrier to economic and technological interactions amongst countries, by embedding a measure of geographical distance into two specific channels: international trade and FDI. Empirical results obtained all lend strong support to these hypotheses.

From a theoretical point of view, the concept of Territory's Absorptive Capacity integrates two fields of studies, those of innovation systems and regional science.
Three propositions are developed starting from the consideration that territory's absorptive capacity is dependent on increasing investments in human resource learning in a Region, promoting R&D activities and, above all, integrating knowledge flows through the action of territorial knowledge gatekeepers.

AB	Importing capital inputs has been recognized as a critical channel for technology transfer across countries. We examine whether and to what extent the productive impact of imported capital varies with firms' abilities to absorb new technologies using ordinary least squares, instrumental variable, and threshold regression estimators. We find that firms with higher absorptive capacity gain significantly more from importing foreign capital. Our results also suggest a threshold for such benefits. Furthermore, the productive contribution of skilled labor is significantly higher in firms that import foreign capital. Developing policies to augment absorptive capacity will help firms in developing countries to realize benefits associated with imported capital. (JEL F14, D24, L24, O33)

AB	This study examines why some firms are better able than others to reap benefits from collaborating with their competitors in innovation. Whereas on the general level, collaborative innovation has been studied widely, and firm-specific success factors in collaboration between competitors (i.e., coopetition) have not been exhaustively addressed. Earlier literature describes coopetition as a risky but potentially rewarding relationship in which sharing, learning, and protection of knowledge are recognized as the key issues determining the possible benefits and hazards. This study provides evidence of factors related to this, suggesting that the firm's ability to acquire knowledge from external sources (potential absorptive capacity) and to protect its innovations and core knowledge against imitation (appropriability regime) are relevant in increasing the innovation outcomes of collaborating with its competitors. This study also distinguishes between incremental and radical innovations as an outcome of coopetition, and provides differing implications for the two innovation types. The empirical evidence for the study was gathered from a cross-industry survey conducted on Finnish markets. The data are analyzed with multivariate multiple regression analysis. The results of the analysis suggest that (1) potential absorptive capacity and appropriability regime of the firm both have a positive effect in the pursuit of incremental innovations in coopetition, and (2) in the case of radical innovations, appropriability regime has a positive effect, while the effect of absorptive capacity is not statistically significant. However, the results also indicate that there is a moderating relationship between these variables, in that the potential absorptive capacity is positively associated with creation of radical innovations within high levels of appropriability regime. These results yield important theoretical and managerial implications. As a whole, the results presented in this study provide new evidence on which types of firms can reap success in the challenging task of collaborative innovation with rivals. In the case of incremental innovation, a firm-level emphasis on knowledge sharing and learning will positively affect the results of coopetition, as will an emphasis on knowledge protection. Thus, when incremental developments are pursued in coopetition, firms should not only seek to exchange knowledge to create value but also remember to secure the firm-specific core knowledge within the firm's borders to stay competitive. On the other hand, when the firm is pursuing radical innovation with its rivals, the heaviest emphasis should be on protecting its existing core knowledge and also emerging novel innovations and market opportunities. Capabilities in knowledge acquisition are also beneficial in these cases, but the full benefits of knowledge exchange realize only when the firm's knowledge protection mechanisms are sufficiently strong, allowing for safe knowledge exchange between rivals.

AB	Open innovation (OI) is an innovation paradigm which argues that firms should use external knowledge in order to succeed in the innovation process. It is currently unclear however how firms are able to source external knowledge from external actors when attempting to innovate. In this paper we examine the relationship between absorptive capacity and firms' ability to enter into innovation cooperation with external actors. Our econometric results show that internal R&D, training and an educated workforce, as core aspects of firms' absorptive capacity, are positively associated with (the intensity of) innovation cooperation. An implication is that external knowledge does not enter the firm freely. The costs firms must invoke in order to be able to source external knowledge in the OI context is considerable. Without investing in internal R&D, training and recruiting workers with good educational qualifications, firms may not be able to follow the open approach to innovation.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine a mobile delivery system as a working ubiquitous decision support system (UDSS) and determine whether it would improve decision quality.
Design/methodology/approach - Ubiquitous mobility and context awareness are the two core functions of the UDSS. Hence the authors examined how they might influence individual absorptive capacity and perceived usefulness. Moreover the authors investigated how individual absorptive capacity and perceived usefulness might be related to decision quality. A total of 174 completed questionnaires were collected from delivery workers, and a financial incentive was provided to participants. To test the hypotheses the research model was analysed with the partial least square method.
Findings - The results reveal that all paths are statistically valid. Individual absorptive capacity and perceived usefulness were positively influenced by ubiquitous mobility and context awareness. In addition individual absorptive capacity and perceived usefulness have positive effects on decision quality.
Research limitations/implications - This research model did not consider all the capabilities enabled by the UDSS. Future study should pay attention to nomadicity, proactiveness, invisibility, and portability as relevant antecedents within the model.
Originality/value - In the field of IS studies the impact of the UDSS on users' decision quality has remained unclear to date. The authors adopted a mobile delivery system as a working UDSS and applied it in their study. Thereby the authors found the mediating effects of perceived usefulness and absorptive capacity under a ubiquitous environment.

AB	Purpose - The paper examines the moderating role of a purchasing function's absorptive capacity (AC) on the relationship between the use of electronic purchasing tools and category, level purchasing performance. The authors argue that an e-purchasing tool may not in itself positively influence performance unless combined with AC as a human interface to maximise its information and transactional improvement potential.
Design/methodology/approach - Survey data collected from 297 procurement executives of large companies in ten countries are analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical moderated regression.
Findings - The results demonstrate few significant direct effects of e-purchasing tools on category performance. All performance measures studied are enhanced when dimensions of AC and their interactions with the e-purchasing tools are added. Specifically, buyer competence, manager competence and communications climate have performance-enhancing effects. In some cases, AC on its own appears to increase performance more than e-tools.
Originality/value - This paper is the first to study the moderating effects-of AC on the relationship between e-purchasing tool usage and category performance. Its findings support the view that simply implementing technology does not lead to performance improvements, but that a human interface is required to maximise the information and transactional improvement potential of e-purchasing tools.

AB	Purpose - Drawing on the resource-based view and network theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of external networks (ENs) and absorptive capacity (AC) in export market location decision of emerging economy firms (EEFs) and the performance implication of this decision.
Design/methodology/approach - This study employs structural equation modeling to test three hypotheses: first, ENs influence an EEF manager's propensity to enter culturally/psychically distant markets for exports. Distant markets are more likely to be chosen by managers of firms with abundant ENs. Second, AC moderates this network-market location relationship. Third, superior performance results from the fit between managers' propensity to enter a market and firms' levels of ENs and AC.
Findings - An analysis of 196 Chinese exporting firms supports the hypotheses.
Research limitations/implications Though the theoretical discussion is general, the empirical context is specific to Chinese export manufacturers. Replicating the study is necessary in different contexts.
Practical implications - The study identifies to managers the importance of external (i.e. ENs) and internal resources and capabilities (i.e. AC) and linkages between resources and capabilities, strategy and performance.
Originality/value - The study is novel in conceptually addressing the role of ENs and AC in firms' decision making and performance and in testing hypotheses with robust methodology and data.

However, firms have no equal ability to access and to apply that knowledge, meaning that not all have a similar knowledge absorptive capacity. Using a sample of the largest Portuguese firms within a footwear cluster, this paper examine whether there are significant differences in firm's absorptive capacity and whether such differences within a cluster are related to firms' specific characteristics. The results suggest that absorptive capacity is significantly associated with the firms' characteristics, namely size, export intensity and position within the cluster.

The research was conducted in order to analyze how does the capability of the organizations from Serbian knowledge-intensive industries to acquire external knowledge, develop their knowledge base, communicate and exploit the absorbed knowledge affect their absorptive capacity. The methodology included quantitative and qualitative research method based on a questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed with the absorptive capacity evaluation model and by applying discriminant function analysis as a statistical method. The basic result shows that the absorptive capacity of organizations from knowledge-intensive industries in Serbia is clearly dependent on the scope of the available relevant knowledge. The fundamental conclusion as the result of this research indicates that the enrichment of the organizational knowledge bases with the relevant new content strongly enhances the absorptive capacity of organizations from knowledge-intensive industries in Serbia. Further research on this topic should be directed towards investigating the relationship between the existing knowledge base and the innovation capability in organizations from knowledge-intensive industries.

This paper argues that, knowledge spillover entrepreneurship depends not only on new knowledge but more importantly on entrepreneurial absorptive capacity that allows entrepreneurs to understand new knowledge, recognize its value, and commercialize it by creating a firm. This absorptive capacity theory of knowledge spillover entrepreneurship is tested using data based on U.S. metropolitan areas.

AB	Researchers and practitioners regard information technology (IT) as a competitive tool. However, current knowledge on IT capability mechanisms that affect firm performance remains unclear. Based on the dynamic capabilities perspective and the view of a hierarchy of capabilities, this article proposes a model to examine how IT capabilities (i.e., flexible IT infrastructure and IT assimilation) affect firm performance through absorptive capacity and supply chain agility in the supply chain context. Survey data show that absorptive capacity and supply chain agility fully mediate the influences of IT capabilities on firm performance. In addition to the direct effects, absorptive capacity also has indirect effects on firm performance by shaping supply chain agility. We conclude with implications and suggestions for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of the study is to analyze the moderating role of the components of the absorptive capacity identification and combination in the process that leads firms in industrial districts with social capital to obtain effective innovations through the knowledge acquisition. We have developed the empirical analysis on a sample of 166 firms located in the industrial districts of the footwear industry in Spain. Findings suggest that the firms in industrial districts improve the acquisition of novel and valuable knowledge from external networks of information when they have identification capabilities to explore their potential. The results also indicate combinative capability strengthens the acquired new knowledge to develop and exploit successful innovations.

AB	In this paper, I present novel microeconomic evidence on the effects of firm heterogeneity on the creation and impact of technology transfers from foreign direct investment (FDI) to local suppliers in a developing country setting. The main findings are threefold. First, FDI firms are significantly more involved in knowledge transfer activities than domestic producer firms. In particular, FDI firms offer more technological support, support with a direct positive impact on production processes of local suppliers. Second, the type of ownership also influences the effect of the technology gap on technology transfers. A large technology gap between a producer firm and its suppliers lowers the provision of support; however, FDI firms offer more technological support to their suppliers of material inputs when the technology gap is large. Independent of the support that the suppliers receive, foreign ownership of client firms and a large technology gap make it more likely that suppliers experience large positive impacts. Third, the level of absorptive capacity of local suppliers is also important for the impact of the technology transfers, confirming the notion that heterogeneity among both producer firms and local suppliers affect the level, nature and impact of local technology transfers.

AB	In a mixed duopoly with a labor-managed firm and a profit-maximizing firm coexisting, this paper explores the effect of technology absorptive capacity on firms' output decision, R&D investment decision and social welfare. Firstly, we develop a two-stage R&D game model on the basis of cost-reducing R&D with spillover and absorptive capacity. Secondly, we explore the strategic interactions of output, R&D investment and social welfare respectively in the mixed duopoly with a labor-managed and a profit-maximizing firms. Finally we analyze the effects of absorptive capacity on output decision, strategic investment decision and social welfare respectively. The research suggests that labor-managed firms employ less workers and produce less outputs while they invest more in R&D than that of profit-maximizing firms. Whether the effect of absorptive capacity increases R&D investment of labor-managed firms or not depends on the returns to scale. However, it bears no relationship to the returns to scale of the profit-maximizing firm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We examined how the adoption of two integrative dissemination mechanisms, unified internal communication and information technology integration, is critical to enhancing employee market knowledge absorptive capacity. Using data from 211 industrial firms, we found that the existence of a greater market knowledge base and explicit market knowledge within firms determines the use of these mechanisms, which in turn increases employee absorptive capacity. Indeed, the mechanisms serve as full mediators for this ability, thus accentuating their value for knowledge, information technology, and innovation management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical analysis employs a broad set of indicators measuring national innovative capabilities and absorptive capacity for a panel of 87 countries in the period 1980-2007, and makes use of panel cointegration analysis to investigate long-run relationships and coevolution patterns among these variables. The results indicate that the dynamics of national systems of innovation is driven by the coevolution of three innovative capability variables (innovative input, scientific output and technological output), on the one hand, and three absorptive capacity factors (infrastructures, international trade and human capital), on the other. This general result does however differ and take specific patterns in national systems characterized by different levels of development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB	Absorptive capacity (ACAP) refers to a firm's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit new knowledge. Research has yet to acknowledge the possibility of limits to the financial returns of this important strategic construct. This study suggests an inverted-U shaped relationship between ACAP and financial performance. Based on data from 285 technology-based small and medium enterprises, we observe gains within three prospective, secondary measures of growth to diminish beyond lower levels of ACAP, even turning negative and becoming harmful beyond intermediate levels. We find that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) moderates the ACAP-performance relationship, enhancing financial gains at lower levels of ACAP and mitigating the decline in financial performance at higher levels of ACAP. Further, with higher EO, higher ACAP can be achieved before financial returns diminish.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB	Extant literature offers two mostly distinct perspectives on enterprise systems assimilation driven either by internal expertise and learning capability or by external institutional pressures. This study combines the two perspectives and subscribes to the view that organisations' learning capability moderates their acquiescence to institutional pressures. The study then anchors organisational learning capability to the concept of absorptive capacity and proposes that its two dimensions potential absorptive capacity (PACAP) and realised absorptive capacity (RACAP) affect enterprise systems assimilation through different pathways. Our survey-based empirical study of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in the post-implementation stage reveals that while both PACAP and RACAP have a positive direct impact on assimilation, PACAP positively moderates the impact of mimetic (institutional) pressures, but not normative (institutional) pressures, on assimilation; whereas RACAP positively moderates the impact of normative pressures, but not mimetic pressures, on assimilation. Thus, our theoretical contribution lies in understanding the distinct ways in which PACAP and RACAP moderate the influence of external institutional pressures on enterprise systems assimilation.

AB	This paper develops a taxonomy of buyersupplier relationships (BSRs), based on the supplier's absorptive capacity (AC). AC encompasses three learning processes: exploration, assimilation, and exploitation. The aim is to develop a taxonomy that can predict a firm's performance with regard to innovation and operational efficiency. This research complements the literature, which presently focuses on descriptive rather than predictive taxonomies. Data from 153 firms were collected through survey research. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the quality of data and calculate composite scores to be used in the cluster analysis to develop the BSRs patterns. Analysis of variance was used to explore the relationships between BSR type and firm performance. Finally, semi-structured interviews aided interpretation of the proposed taxonomy. Findings support the identification of groups of dyads through different combinations of the learning processes underlying AC. The different combinations are typified through AC strength and AC reinforcement. The results provide evidence of a significant relationship between AC strength and firm performance. Surprisingly, we did not find empirical support for the relationship between AC reinforcement and performance.

AB	The study investigates how a multinational corporation (MNC) can promote the absorptive capacity of its subsidiaries. The focus is on what drives the MNC subsidiary's ability to absorb marketing strategies that are initiated by the MNC parent, as well as how the subsidiary enacts on this absorptive capacity in order to compete in its focal market. The dual embeddedness of MNC subsidiaries plays a key role in this investigation, as subsidiaries belong to the MNC network and are simultaneously embedded in their host country environment. We argue that subsidiary absorptive capacity is formed as a purposeful response to this dual embeddedness. An analysis of marketing strategy absorptions undertaken by 213 subsidiaries reveals that MNCs can assist their subsidiaries to compete in competitive and dynamic focal markets by forming specific organizational mechanisms that are conducive to the development of subsidiary absorptive capacity. The findings hold important theoretical and practical implications.

Data were collected from 761 core knowledge employees, 148 CEOs, and 148 HR executives from 148 high-technology firms. The results indicated that core knowledge employee creativity was negatively related to firm performance when riskiness orientation was high. The relationship was positive when realized absorptive capacity was high. Finally, the relationship was more positive in small firms than in large firms. We discuss the implications of our findings for creativity research and managerial practices.

Addressing a gap in the literature, this study adopts the definition and structure for AC suggested by Tu et al. (2006) to examine relationships between AC's sub-dimensions with NPD performance, and also their moderating effects on the relationship between supplier involvement and new product development performance, on both financial and nonfinancial aspects. Data from a survey of 161 manufacturing firms are used to test the developed hypotheses using structural equation modelling and hierarchical regression. Direct and contingent effects of supplier involvement and AC on new product development performance are studied. As a result factors determining AC are found of different level of effects on financial and nonfinancial performance of new products, which will have implication for theory and practice.

AB	Top managers of multinational corporations are increasingly confronted with an accelerating rate of change in the external environment. Yet strategic renewal literature has devoted limited attention to the organizational mechanisms enabling firms to align internal with external rates of change, so as to achieve a dynamic firm-environment fit over time. This paper addresses that gap by taking a knowledge-based perspective. We develop a framework clarifying how a firm's potential absorptive capacity enables it to align internal with external rates of change. We illustrate the framework empirically by analyzing the rate of change in strategic renewal actions of Royal Dutch Shell as an indicator of the company's internal rate of change in the period 1980-2007, and by comparing it with external rates of change in the oil industry over the same period. The findings show that Shell's potential absorptive capacity was positively related to the alignment of internal and external rates of change. In addition, we find evidence that the degree of alignment was positively related to the company's performance during the observation period. Our study implies that managers who are aiming to align internal and external rates of change over time should: 1) monitor external rates of change through environmental scanning and boundary spanning, 2) create shared understanding of the long-term implications of change, 3) identify drivers of internal rates of change and understand how to pace the rate of strategic renewal actions, and finally, 4) maintain baseline levels of potential absorptive capacity, since increasing potential absorptive capacity takes time and requires a long-term perspective.

AB	This study investigates the role of absorptive capacity in implementing green logistics practices and the impact of the implementation on green logistics performance (GLP). Data were collected from a survey of 279 Australian Logistics and Transport operators and analysed using structural equation modelling. The findings indicate that enhancing green logistics knowledge exploitation is important to improve GLP. This can be achieved through changing the logistics operations and incorporating new knowledge into green practices in a way that can reduce CO2 emission, fuel consumption, or the cost of environmental compliance. The findings also show that addressing environmental concerns requires a process in which environmental information, through a wide range of channels and practices, is acquired, assimilated, transformed, and exploited. The paper reports an original research that contributes to the understanding of the value of green practices and routines to the environmental performance of firms in the Logistics and Transport sector. The results provide practitioners with insights that facilitate the transformation towards greener logistics practices and routines.

AB	This paper empirically tests the effectiveness of information and communications technology (ICT) knowledge transfer and adoption in the multinational enterprise (MNE) as an issue of critical importance to contemporary MNE functioning. In contrast to mainstream thinking on absorptive capacity, but in line with prevailing international business theory, our research supports the proposition that perceptions of procedural justice, rather than absorptive capacity, determine effectiveness, especially in cases of high tacit knowledge transfers.
Data was collected from senior ICT representatives in 86 Canadian subsidiaries of foreign owned MNEs. Each of these subsidiaries recently experienced a significant ICT transfer imposed by the parent organization.
Support was found for the main propositions: Procedural justice significantly predicted successful ICT transfer and adoption, while absorptive capacity was not significant. These findings are consistent even when knowledge tacitness was high.
The perceived success of the ICT transfer as well as its adoption varied widely across these firms. The potential reasons for this divergence in effectiveness are manifold, but our findings suggest that in situations of substantial knowledge tacitness, a higher level of procedural justice, rather than a higher level of absorptive capacity, is critical to effective transfer and adoption.

We use two alternative approaches. In the first, we estimate TFP and apply a diff-in-diff estimator with a control group constructed by propensity-score matching. In the second, direct method, we estimate TFP with imported inputs as a state variable in one stage. Both approaches show that the effect of a firm's decision to source intermediates and capital equipment abroad on its TFP depends critically on its capacity to absorb technology, measured by the proportion of skilled labour.

AB	With the advent of globalization - a 21st century phenomenon - many corporations have been developing inroads into overseas markets. As international competition continues to intensify, some companies and researchers have taken a profound interest in the social cognitions, reactions, backgrounds, and behaviors of members in organizations. In line with these tendencies, organizational culture, along with absorptive capacity, is becoming one of the decisive factors. This study aims to use empirical analysis to identify the relationships between organizational culture, absorptive capacity, and performance of international logistics service providers (ILSP) in Korea.
The empirical research shows that (1) there is no direct relationship between the construct of power distance and performance; (2) absorptive capacity has no mediation effect on the relationship between the construct of uncertainty avoidance and business performance; (3) in the case of the constructs of masculinity and femininity and individualism and collectivism, there is a full mediation effect only on financial performance; (4) there is partial mediation between long-term orientation and non-financial performance.
Overall, the results of this study suggest that managers of ILSP should bear in mind that the constructs of organizational culture have considerable influence over an organization's absorptive capacity and business performance. These firms should acknowledge these influences and apply appropriate strategies, focusing on known weaknesses, to effectively strengthen their competitive market positions and long-term survival and success.

AB	High growth and progressive regions possess a culture that promotes innovation. Innovation depends on a region's ability to use its own existing knowledge and knowledge generated elsewhere. This paper demonstrates the importance of the ability to absorb external knowledge in explaining innovation productivity for 106 U. S. metropolitan areas. Using a spatial interaction model of patent citation flows with origin and destination dependence, the destination fixed-effects coefficients provides a measure of a region's absorptive capacity. We identify local conditions that shape a region's absorptive capacity and demonstrate it has a positive and significant impact on innovation productivity.

AB	The complementarities between internal capabilities and external linkages have been widely acknowledged in the open innovation literature, yet little is known about the extent to which internal capabilities affect firms' openness within different institutional contexts. This paper therefore empirically explores the relationship between absorptive capacity (ACAP) and openness in the United States and European biopharmaceutical sectors. Based on analysis of data from a large-scale international survey of 349 biopharmaceutical firms in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, the results suggest that exploratory openness depends more strongly on the research and development (R&D) aspect of firms' potential absorptive capacity, whereas exploitative openness is more conditional on firms' realized absorptive capacity (RACAP). The results also highlight the major differences between firms' openness and ACAP in the United States and Europe - in the United States, firms' skill levels prove more significant in contributing to firms' engagement with exploratory relationships, whereas in Europe, continuity of R&D proves more important. Engagement with exploitative relationships, however, is more conditional on firms' RACAP in Europe only.

AB	Information Technology (IT) offers many opportunities for firms to succeed. The aim of this paper is to present a model to reflect how technical IT skills and the use of IT in interdependent tasks may influence the development of organisational absorptive capacity, both potential and realised, which also affects organisational performance. Since knowledge constitutes one of the main resources for organisations to gain competitive advantages and helps firms to improve their organisational performance, absorptive capacity is a key factor in success. This model was tested empirically using a sample of 160 European technological firms. The results of our analysis suggest that the mastery of technical IT skills and the use of IT in interdependent tasks positively affect potential and realised absorptive capacities, which in turn enhances organisational performance. The study concludes by presenting some theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future research lines.

In this paper, we estimate the instantaneous and long-run productivity effects of exporting on the universe of Chinese manufacturing firms. We find that exporting has very different productivity effects for firms with different pre-export R&D status. It has large and lasting productivity effects for firms with pre-export R&D, while it has little effects for firms without pre-export R&D. Furthermore, the effect of exporting increases with the number of years of pre-export R&D investment.

AB	In contemporary business environments, the ability to manage operational knowledge is an important predictor of organizational competitiveness. Organizations invest large sums in various types of information technologies (ITs) to manage operational knowledge. Because of their superior storage, processing and communication capabilities, ITs offer technical platforms to build knowledge management (KM) capabilities. However, merely acquiring ITs are not sufficient, and organizations must structure information system (IS) designs to leverage ITs for building KM capabilities. We study how technical and strategic IS designs enhance operational absorptive capacity (OAC) - the KM capability of an operations management (OM) department. Specifically, we use a capabilities perspective of absorptive capacity to examine potential absorptive capacity (POAC) and realized absorptive capacity (ROAC) capabilities - the two OAC capabilities that create and utilize knowledge, respectively. Our theory proposes that integrated IS capability, - an aspect of technical IS design - is an antecedent of POAC and ROAC capabilities, and business-IT alignment - an aspect of strategic IS design - moderates the relationship between integrated IS capability and ROAC capability. Combining data gleaned from a multi-respondent survey with archival data from COMPUSTAT, we test our hypotheses using a dataset from 153 manufacturing organizations. By proposing that IS design enables an OM department's KM processes, i.e., the POAC and ROAC capabilities, our interdisciplinary theoretical framework opens the "black box" of OAC and contributes to improved understanding of IS and OM synergies. We offer a detailed discussion of our contributions to the literature at the IS-OM interface and implications for practitioners. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	Firms from several advanced developing countries have successfully upgraded to higher levels of capability and competitiveness on the international stage. This study explores how leading Taiwanese latecomer firms acquired strong capabilities in the display (thin film transistor-liquid crystal display, TFT-LCD) industry. We identify how these firms acquired the technology base to catch up rapidly and move from one set of advanced products and technologies to another, focusing on both the accumulation of technological capabilities and the underlying absorptive capacity of each firm. Empirically, we distinguish three phases of capability building, namely pre-entry, entry, and innovation and diversification. Theoretically, we suggest that the notion of latecomer' absorptive capacity, centred on engineering and design rather than R&D, might explain both the rapidity of recent technological catch up and the diversification across products and technologies as latecomer firms approach the technology frontier.

To examine this, based on the fact that absorptive capacity is developed through the ability to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit externally-generated knowledge, we look at the importance of each of these dimensions at firms pursuing different business strategies. To reflect business strategy, we draw on Miles and Snow's typology. The information has been obtained based on a sample made up of 81 Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises. Results show that knowledge acquisition capacity is greater at prospectors than at defenders and analysers, and that transformation and exploitation capacities are greater at prospectors than at defenders. No differences in knowledge assimilation capacity are observed.

AB	Research into the phenomenon of social innovation has long focused on what it is and why people become engaged in this form of behaviour. However, another piece of the theoretical jigsaw requires understanding how this type of innovation is enacted by organisations. This article looks at the means by which not-for-profit ventures pursuing socially innovative activities develop the necessary capabilities to innovate. The multidimensional theoretical construct of absorptive capacity and the evolutionary economics concept of organisational routines are used to analyse 14 case studies of innovative not-for-profit ventures in Australia and the UK. The results show that these organisations have a unique mediating function in the social innovation process by configuring internal and external absorptive capacity routines to combine user and technological knowledge flows. The article concludes by proposing some research directions for those taking forward the study of social innovation.

Building on prior research, we delineate flexibility-oriented human resource management (FHRM) systems in terms of resource- and coordination-flexibility-oriented HRM subsystems. In addition, we draw on organizational learning theory and the concept of absorptive capacity (AC) to articulate the mechanisms through which these systems might influence market responsiveness and firm innovativeness. We develop and validate measures of FHRM systems using a series of four independent samples. Our findings based on a sample of high-technology firms indicate that FHRM systems are positively associated with firm-level potential and realized AC and that potential AC, in turn, is positively associated with market responsiveness and firm innovativeness.

Capabilities contribute through their uniqueness, their integration into effective configurations, and their deployment in response to external environment changes. Therefore, this study examines the individual (uniqueness) and interactive (integration) effects of knowledge creation capability and absorptive capacity on product innovativeness as well as how these effects vary in differing technologically turbulent contexts (deployment). Based on a survey of 212 Chinese firms, this study finds that in addition to their individually positive effects, knowledge creation capability and absorptive capacity have a synergistic effect on product innovativeness. Moreover, the individual effect of knowledge creation capability and the synergistic effect become stronger as technological turbulence increases, whereas the impact of absorptive capacity tends to be dampened by technological turbulence.

We analyze Objective 1 transfers of the EU to regions below a certain income level by way of a regression discontinuity design with systematically varying heterogeneous treatment effects. Only about 30 percent and 21 percent of the regions-those with sufficient human capital and good-enough institutions-are able to turn transfers into faster per capita income growth and per capita investment, respectively. In general, the variance of the treatment effect is much bigger than its mean.

AB	Entrants are often viewed as suffering from a "liability of newness"-at founding, they rarely possess the knowledge and capabilities necessary to compete and survive. They can overcome this liability by learning vicariously from the knowledge of incumbent firms. But how can entrants learn from external knowledge when they lack the prior related knowledge that forms the basis of absorptive capacity? We theorize that the process of internal experiential learning facilitates learning from external knowledge, particularly for entrants. To test this theory, we examine learning using a comprehensive set of U.S. commercial banking firms, including a full census of entrants. Our estimates suggest that the share of vicarious learning realized in the process of experiential learning is twice as large for entrants as for incumbents. In this sense, entrants enjoy an "advantage of newness" in learning.

Further analysis confirms that absorptive capacity has a stronger moderating effect on the relationship between local linkages and innovation than it does on the relationship between international linkages and innovation.

AB	Introduction. Managers frequently question whether the effort in collecting market information and disseminating it within their firm leads to improved processing. The purpose of this paper is to provide a useful indicator to evaluate the ability of employees to process and exploit market knowledge. To this end, we develop and validate a measurement scale of 'market knowledge absorptive capacity'.
Method. We utilize deductive and inductive approaches for item generation and structural equation modelling for detailed assessment of the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of the measurement scale.
Analysis. We performed the analyses with LISREL 8.80 statistical package software using data from 211 industrial firms.
Results. The results validate a parsimonious four-dimensional scale consisting of acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation capacities. The psychometric properties of the scale are successfully assessed. Nomological validity is confirmed by demonstrating a positive relationship between market knowledge absorptive capacity and innovation performance.
Conclusions. The proposed multidimensional scale can be used as a diagnostic tool for firms to evaluate the capacity of employees to effectively absorb market knowledge. It can also be considered a valuable extension to the existing research on absorptive capacity as it helps overcome the limited nature of previous measures.

AB	Two factors jointly determine the likelihood of a firm's competitors obtaining information on its intangible assets and using it to damage the firm's innovation performance. Those factors are the absorptive capacity of the rival firm and the appropriability regime of the innovating firm. However, the precise roles of the two factors in affecting performance outcomes are not well documented. Furthermore, we lack knowledge of the interplay between an appropriability regime and absorptive capacity, although they clearly have the capacity to exert positive and negative effects both on each other and on innovativeness. This study presents findings derived from theoretical discussion and an empirical examination of 155 firms that suggest that while competitors' absorptive capacity does not play a direct negative or positive role on the innovation performance of a firm, an appropriability regime exerts a strong positive influence. Nevertheless, high rival absorptive capacity is not without importance, since the significant interaction effects suggest that a strong appropriability regime has positive effects on innovation performance especially in the context of a rival having high absorptive capacity.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ agility concept to develop a contingency perspective of relationship between suppliers' involvement, absorptive capacity (AC) and product innovation (PI). While the moderating effect of AC on the relationship between supplier involvement and PI performance is investigated, a firm's agility in PI is entered as one dimension of the firm's performance to accommodate a multidimensional perspective.
Design/methodology/approach - The paper formulates six hypotheses extracted from the relevant literature. The survey was conducted over the internet by using web-based questionnaire. A sampling frame of 1,200 manufacturing UK-based companies provided 233 usable responses. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to test a validity and reliability of constructs and further the paper employed hierarchical multiple regression to test the research hypotheses.
Findings - The results while reaffirm some of the existing theories of the subject provide some differing view of the issues allowing projection of new insight on the approach to PI and involvement of suppliers. The results support the proposition of PI performance multidimensionality where achievements beyond financial and market-related factors play a critical role. Furthermore, research findings suggest AC as a competitive factor that can provide the grounds for proactively winning in the PI game through increasing agility capabilities.
Research limitations/implications - This study uses a random sample of UK manufacturing companies, which could be extended to firms from outside the UK too.
Originality/value - The paper provides a new insight into the existing literature on "new product innovation" and its relationship with suppliers' involvement as well as the firm's AC by employing agility perspective, as a leading theory to explain dynamics and uncertainties in the business environment.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of service innovation in networks. Especially the most loosely coupled forms of innovation networks, innovation communities, can be valuable in service innovation, but may not be manageable in the traditional sense. Rather, they may require orchestration characterized by discreet guidance that also accommodates the specific nature of services. Through informed orchestration, it is possible to deal with several contingencies, and influence the absorptive capacity at the network level to generate new service innovations.
Design/methodology/approach - These issues are examined through literature review and a case study.
Findings - The findings suggest that individual orchestration mechanisms may be more closely connected to certain contingencies than others, and that both orchestration mechanisms and contingency factors have a role in absorptive capacity development within service innovation networks.
Research limitations/implications - While the case study approach limits the possibility to make wide generalizations, the in-depth insights provide valuable knowledge.
Practical implications - There has been a shift from inter-firm competition towards competition between networks of organizations, increasing relevance of absorptive capacity at the network level.
Originality/value - Despite the recent increase in service innovation literature, research on service innovation taking place in networks is scant. Knowledge on some aspects can be derived from more traditional notions on technological innovation, but both the distinctive features of services and central characteristics of innovation networks make it necessary to reconsider some of the established views. In particular, managing - or rather orchestrating - service innovation is still a challenging area.

However, technology absorptive capacity is the determining factor of FDI technology spillover effect. Further analysis shows that technology absorptive capabilities respectively represented by institutional change and human resources have different effects on the endogenous economic growth and the FDI technology spillovers. To be more specific, the effect of technology absorptive capacity represented by the level of human resources on the economic growth and FDI technology spillovers is much more significant than that represented by institutional change.

AB	Purpose - This paper tests which theoretical perspective(s) can better explain firms' external knowledge search behavior. Information processing and resource-based view theories propose a positive relationship between environmental turbulence and knowledge search breadth, whereas transaction cost economics and managerial attention theoretical perspectives posit that knowledge search breadth will be negatively influenced by environmental turbulence. In the context of Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), this study examines the direct effect of environmental turbulence and the interactive effect of environmental turbulence and absorptive capacity (ACAP) on external knowledge search breadth.
Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted firm-level data collected via questionnaires from SMEs within the manufacturing sector in China. The partial least squares method was used to explore the determinants of the external knowledge search breadth of Chinese SMEs.
Findings - The results reveal that external search breadth tends to increase with an increase in a firm's perceived environmental turbulence. In addition, the interaction between ACAP and environmental turbulence will be negatively related to external knowledge search breadth. The empirical evidence indicates information processing and resource-based view theories are more powerful in explaining the external knowledge search behavior of Chinese SMEs.
Originality/value - Unlike most of the innovation search literature, which have focused on the effect on performance of external search, this study focuses on the antecedents of firms' innovation search behavior. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between environmental turbulence and knowledge search breadth as well as the understanding of the influence of ACAP on external knowledge search in the context of SMEs from emerging economies.

Practical implications - The findings indicate that more effective in increasing the performance of IT project teams can be to strengthen empowering leadership than to promote traditional charisma or directive leadership. Knowledge sharing at a team level has the direct effect of improving project performance by providing information and knowledge regarding the related project, but on the other hand it contributes to making stronger the path of associating absorptive capacity with project performance.
Originality/value - The impact of empowering leaderships on team performance of IT project has received less research attention. Little prior research has carried out such an integrated analysis in IT service context. This study contributes to knowledge management research by identifying a key antecedent of knowledge sharing.

AB	Purpose - After information systems (IS) implementation, many organizations report that system underutilization causes the failure to meet expected IS investment returns. It is imperative to understand the way to leverage employees' fullest potential in the IS usage. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
Design/methodology/approach - Anchoring on absorptive capacity (ACAP) theory, the authors develop an employee innovation model. Using survey data and structural equation modeling, this research investigates how perceived organizational levers affect innovation with IS usage (INVU) by introducing individual ACAP as a mediator.
Findings - The authors find general support for the research model through a survey of 205 employees using SAP business intelligence systems in China. The empirical data shows that three interrelated components of individual ACAP significantly contribute to INVU. The findings also suggest that, both fairness of reward and job autonomy are key organizational levers for the utility of individual ACAP. Furthermore, their effects on INVU can be fully mediated by individual ACAP.
Originality/value - The authors empirically unpack and validate individual ACAP in IS innovation situation. The findings provide academics and practitioners with an understanding of how management can inspire employees' potential in implemented system innovation.

AB	The paper extends available findings on the antecedents and impact of the firm's absorptive capacity. Innovation cooperation is recognized as a driver of its potential side (PAC). Considering different forms of proximity, we expect to find a higher impact for interactions occurring between close partners. Human capital (HC) is expected to be as important as other organizational mechanisms for the innovation impact of PAC. An empirical application with Community Innovation Survey data confirms these arguments only partially. The firm's cooperation with geographically closer partners (i.e., in the same country) increases its PAC, but it is cooperation with institutionally distant ones (e.g., research organizations) that augments it. Among the integration mechanisms of external knowledge, those increasing the firm's HC are the only ones that positively moderate the innovation impact of PAC.

AB	Although networks in prior research have been highlighted as a remedy to resource constraints experienced by smaller firms, little attention has been paid to understanding mechanisms through which smaller firms benefit from networks for effective innovation performance. In this paper we develop a conceptual model of direct and moderated network effects on a firm's innovation. We test this model on a large sample of small and medium-sized firms from a post-transitional and developed economy. We show that absorptive capacity moderates the relationship between networks and innovation outcomes, but with some country level variations. The implications of these results in relation to entrepreneurship theory and practice are discussed.

AB	Realizing the innovation potential of OSS communities, firms now create or sponsor their own open source software (OSS) communities, generally as part of an open innovation strategy. However, maximizing the innovation capability of a sponsored OSS community is a challenging task since firms cannot rely on traditional hierarchical authority to control community members. Furthermore, a firm's efforts to manage its sponsored community may also impact the firm's absorptive capacity, or its ability to effectively absorb and leverage the valuable knowledge created by the community. Thus, the purpose of this article is to investigate two research questions: 1) How does the boundary management of a firm-sponsored OSS community impact the community's innovation capacity? and 2) How does the boundary management of a firm-sponsored OSS community impact the firm's absorptive capacity? Using the results from our qualitative analysis of eZ Systems and its successfully sponsored OSS community - eZ Publish we develop a theoretical model depicting how the boundary management of a firm-sponsored OSS community influences both the community's innovation capacity and the absorptive capacity of the firm. In addition, the results of our study highlight the central importance of an integrative IT platform in boundary management activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, it attempts to identify the critical factors facilitating the acquisition of technology from foreign partner firms and performance enhancement in international collaborative formations. Second, it compares these factors across Western and Japanese sub-samples. A new concept, realised absorptive capacity, is employed to achieve these objectives. Using a sample collected through a questionnaire-based survey, our results show that trust and communication are critical components in transforming new knowledge, while active managerial involvement of the foreign firm and the participation of foreign expatriates are the keys to applying it for business operations. In particular, components consisting of the ability to exploit new knowledge (i.e. active managerial involvement of foreign firm, participation of foreign expatriates and provision of training) are closely associated with performance enhancement. In addition, our results confirm that there clearly exist different patterns of learning mechanisms and incompatible behaviours in improving performance between the two sub-samples. Based on the results, the authors suggest implications and future research avenues.

AB	This paper addresses how firms from an emerging market characterized by a challenging and variable institutional environment learn about internationalizing. Building on the organizational learning and institutional literatures, and the concept of absorptive capacity (AC), and using a sample of Indonesian manufacturing-sector exporters we identify two dimensions of internationalization-related AC: international market and international strategic operation. Unlike previous literature, we find that indirect, or second-hand, experience contributes more than the firm's own experience to the development of international market AC. Furthermore, the second-hand experience feeds Indonesian manufacturing exporters' learning in both positive (e.g., buyers) and negative (e.g., suppliers and foreign multinationals in Indonesia) ways. In contrast, the development of international operation strategy AC appears to be driven internally, with minimal contribution from either first- or second-hand experience. We posit that these outcomes are influenced by the rapid and substantial changes in the domestic institutional environment faced by the Indonesian manufacturers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB	While research has produced ample evidence showing that absorptive capacity affects innovation and organizational performance outcomes, we still know little about why some organizations possess greater absorptive capacity than others. This study extends previous research by showing how absorptive capacity emerges as an unintended consequence from organizational boundary spanners' external and internal relational embeddedness and their relational empowerment. Drawing upon survey data from 218 inter-organizational projects in the German engineering industry, we propose and find empirically that potential and realized absorptive capacity have partially distinct antecedents. Moreover, we show that the two components of absorptive capacity unfold not only separate but also complementary effects on innovation, implying that the whole of absorptive capacity is greater than its parts. In examining how different components of absorptive capacity emerge and unfold their effects, this study addresses critical limitations of the literature on absorptive capacity.

AB	Companies increasingly depend upon the knowledge of supply chain partners to deliver superior value to customers with ever shifting preferences. This transference requires absorptive capacity (AC), which allows an organization to identify external knowledge and convert it into value for the firm. Based on an approach of dynamic capabilities, AC encompasses three related learning processes: exploration, assimilation, and exploitation. Within the particular context of buyer-supplier relationships (BSR), the aim of this research is to examine AC, one of its most relevant antecedents - organizational compatibility - and its outcomes. Two samples of 153 and 199 companies, operating as key suppliers of two focal buyers, a European multinational retail chain and an American multinational spare parts distributor, respectively, constitute the empirical base of the study. Results derived from structural equation modeling and, more precisely, multi-group confirmatory factor analysis and a formal test of mediation, strongly indicate for both samples that AC mediates between organizational compatibility on the one hand and innovation and efficiency performance on the other hand. Results also indicate that the mediating effect of AC related to innovation increases with demand uncertainty. This paper thus suggests that managers must be aware that the selection of supply chain partners based on their compatibility alone is not enough. AC is necessary to achieve
sustainable performance improvement.

AB	Although the literature provides ample evidence that the global transfer and local implementation of knowledge represents a key advantage for multinational corporations (MNCs), we lack comparable understanding as to whether knowledge-creating MNC parents can actively expand the absorptive capacity of their subsidiaries. Using a teacher-student lens, this study examines the combined impact of specific structural mechanisms and motivational processes by MNC parents on the ability of 216 subsidiaries to absorb parent-initiated marketing strategies. The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However, the effect of social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect, and accounted for by the parents' intensity of effort. A number of theoretical implications emerge from the findings for research on absorptive capacity in relation to the role of the knowledge source, the need to examine organizational influences in relation to one another, and validating the original absorptive capacity dimensions. For managers in the global marketplace, the findings lead to the suggestion that MNCs devote attention to nurturing the absorptive capacities at different organizational levels in order to optimize the global transfer of knowledge.

AB	In the following paper we investigate the concept of counter-knowledge and how its effects may be mitigated in an organisational context. Counter-knowledge may be acquired unwittingly from unreliable or inaccurate sources such as gossip, lies, exaggeration and partial truths. We consider that if counter-knowledge is present then specific actions are required to stimulate realised absorptive capacity and, hence, provide for the creation and assimilation of new knowledge and new knowledge structures. Thus, in this paper, we focus on intentional unlearning as a method to counteract the problem of counter-knowledge. We have analysed the relationships between an unlearning context and counter-knowledge using an empirical study of 164 Spanish hospitality companies in order to identify whether the impact of unlearning on RACAP can be strength. A model is tested in which counter-knowledge is simultaneously a hindrance and a challenge stressor. Our results confirm that counter-knowledge is a variable that, when controlled, has the effect of strengthening the relationship between unlearning and RACAP. However, when left uncontrolled, the relationship between unlearning and RACAP is weaker than it otherwise would be. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB	Cooperation can benefit and hurt firms at the same time. An important question then is: when is it better to cooperate? And, once the decision to cooperate is made, how can an appropriate partner be selected? In this paper we present a model of inter-firm cooperation driven by cognitive distance, appropriability conditions and external knowledge. Absorptive capacity of firms develops as an outcome of the interaction between absorptive R&D and cognitive distance from voluntary and involuntary knowledge spillovers. Thus, we offer a revision of the original model by Cohen and Levinthal (Econ J 99(397):569-596, 1989), accounting for recent empirical findings and explicitly modeling absorptive capacity within the framework of interactive learning. We apply that to the analysis of firms' cooperation and R&D investment preferences. The results show that cognitive distance and appropriability conditions between a firm and its cooperation partner have an ambiguous effect on the profit generated by the firm. Thus, a firm chooses to cooperate and selects a partner conditional on the investments in absorptive capacity it is willing to make to solve the understandability/novelty trade-off.

AB	Firms are increasingly employing social media to manage relationships with partner organizations, yet the role of institutional pressures in social media assimilation has not been studied. We investigate social media assimilation in firms using a model that combines the two theoretical streams of IT adoption: organizational innovation and institutional theory. The study uses a composite view of absorptive capacity that includes both previous experience with similar technology and the general ability to learn and exploit new technologies. We find that institutional pressures are an important antecedent to absorptive capacity, an important measure of organizational learning capability. The paper augments theory in finding the role and limits of institutional pressures. Institutional pressures are found to have no direct effect on social media assimilation but to impact absorptive capacity, which mediates its influence on assimilation.

AB	Cross-industry innovation entails distinctive innovation opportunities and challenges according to the knowledge heterogeneity between the collaborating firms. This heterogeneity yields increases in organizational-level cognitive distance. Whereas recent theory suggests cognitive distance is positively related to exploratory innovation, too much distance can hinder efficient knowledge absorption and results in a reduced effect on novelty value. This paper focuses on the research question of how to build potential absorptive capacity for distant collaboration beyond established industry boundaries to gain radical rather than incremental results. To address this question, we mapped a cross-industry network using survey data on 215 bilateral cross-industry collaborations between firms from a variety of industries and captured cognitive proximity (the inverse of distance) in terms of overall knowledge redundancy between firms. This approach introduces a new method to infer organizational-level cognitive distance from network analysis. Subsequently, based on results from the network analysis, we examined coordination antecedents to potential absorptive capacity for cross-industry innovation with partners at moderate and high distance applying case study analysis. Our study revealed three alternative approaches to coordination antecedents that drive a firm's potential absorptive capacity for distant collaboration. These findings extend research on absorptive capacity to the field of cross-industry innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consequently, this study builds and tests a conditional process model. Data comes from a sample of 110 firms from the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector. Results from variance-based structural equation modeling and the PROCESS tool show that RACAP fully mediates the influence of PACAP on IO, and that CB negatively conditions this indirect effect.

AB	In this paper we analyze how firms' R&D investment decisions, firms' profits and social welfare are affected by absorptive capacity; that is, the ability of a firm to learn from other collaborating firms. The model developed is a strategic regular network where firms have the opportunity to form pair-wise collaborative links with other firms and then compete a la Cournot. Different to the existing literature, we find that firms' R&D efforts could increase or decrease with the degree of the network, depending on the level of absorptive capacity, the market size and the network dimension. In particular, in the case of small market size and low learning effect, the connection between firms drives up research investments. Moreover, if absorptive capacity is sufficiently low, the research collaboration between firms turns out not to be desirable from a private point of view while, in line with the existing literature, social efficiency requires a complete or intermediate level of collaborative activity. We also show that the complete network is pair-wise stable and socially optimal for an intermediate level of spillover intensity, while the empty network maximizes firms' profits when absorptive capacity is small, yet it is not pair-wise stable.

AB	In response to recent calls for research on human resource management (HRM) in project management, this research investigates the links between HRM practices, the project team's knowledge absorptive capacity (ACAP) and project performance in project-oriented companies (POCs). Based on survey data from 198 projects in multinational companies (MNCs) in the Thai automotive industry, this research finds that HRM practices moderate the effects of a project team's knowledge ACAP on project performance, in particular of potential ACAP on long-run project performance. In addition, HRM practices covary with a project team's realized ACAP, the other dimension of ACAP, to affect short-run project performance. This research sheds light on the different roles that HRM practices play in a project, finding that HRM practices not only facilitate knowledge management from the current project to future projects but also strengthen the relationship between a project team's knowledge ACAP and long-term project performance. This research contributes to the understanding of HRM in the literature of project management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

AB	The relationship between external knowledge, absorptive capacity (AC) and innovative performance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is investigated empirically. Using data from a survey on firms located in North Norway, we ask whether AC plays a mediating role between different external knowledge inflows and innovative performance. The results are consistent with AC as an important mediator for transforming external knowledge inflows into higher innovative performance if we include all SMEs in the sample. However, this result is not robust when considering the sub-sample of non-R&D SMEs only. External knowledge inflows have a much stronger direct effect on innovation performance for non-R&D firms and leave a weak mediating effect of AC. Our findings suggest that measures of AC should be developed further in order to make AC a more relevant concept for empirical studies of SMEs without in-house R&D.

AB	Theoretically, social capital allows entrepreneurial firms to capitalize on learning advantages of newness and gain access to knowledge as the foundation for improved performance. But this understates its complexity. We consider whether learning through social capital relationships has a direct effect on performance and whether absorptive capacity mediates and moderates this relationship. We find that network-based learning has no direct relationship with performance, but this is mediated in each instance by absorptive capacity and is moderated twice. Our findings challenge the learning advantages of newness thesis and reveal how absorptive capacity can enable business performance from a firm's network relationships.

AB	Previous studies on absorptive capacity focus either upon dyadic interorganizational constellations or upon an organization's environment in general, thus neglecting other managerially relevant interorganizational constellations. Furthermore, despite significant advancements in our understanding, we still know little about the way absorptive capacity actually unfolds on an organizational level, as many studies predominantly take absorptive capacity as a quantitatively measurable phenomenon. We address these two shortcomings by following recent calls for a practice perspective on absorptive capacity. In particular, we reveal the choreography of knowledge absorption practices in an interorganizational network. Based on an empirical study in the semiconductor industry, we put forward the thesis that this can be achieved by congregating, that is, repeatedly exchanging face-to-face ideas at network-wide venues such as conferences or workshops. We illustrate how a lead firm in this industry carefully choreographs congregating, which helps the organization acquire knowledge from network partners and utilize the knowledge internally. Herein, we contribute a practice perspective on how to influence organizational absorptive capacity when engaging with an interorganizational network as a distinctive organizational form. A practice lens also entails being sensitive to the political dimension of absorptive capacity. Moreover, choreographies of bundles of absorptive capacity-relevant practices represent a concept to inform future research.

AB	In this article, we discuss how the adoption and use of social media tools influences new product development (NPD). Our aim is specifically to consider how an organization's absorptive capacity is influenced by using social media tools. Based on a two-phase data collection process comparing the situation before and after adoption of social media tools in three organizations, we conclude that the amount of accessible knowledge and the number of ideas increases as an organization's ability to find and access various sources of intra-organizational expertise increases, thus, increasing knowledge acquisition and assimilation. Consequently, we infer that organizational absorptive capacity rises and is linked to improvement in new product development.

AB	Drawing on two in-depth case studies, this paper develops a conceptual model of how absorptive capacity routines and their underlying processes of evolution influence the efficiency of management innovation adaptation processes. The model highlights three important relations. First, although different configurations of absorptive capacity routines can lead to the successful implementation of the same management innovation - namely the reconfiguration of firms' value chains through sourcing of business services from offshore countries - the sequence of developing routines, their adequacy, and the interdependencies fit between routines partly explain how rapidly and seamlessly a firm is able to implement a management innovation. Second, we identify managerial attention and organizational legitimacy as two critical and interrelated sources of variation of the efficiency in the process of adopting and adapting management innovations. Finally, attention direction by a top-level internal change agent is more effective than local problemistic search to foster managerial attention and organizational legitimacy to both the management innovation to be adopted, and the need to develop and put into practice an appropriate set of absorptive capacity routines.

In this paper we seek to address this research gap studying how Absorptive Capacity can act as a key factor determining the effectiveness of EO in such a context. Specifically, we adopt the knowledge-based view of the firm and explore the moderating effects of Absorptive Capacity's Potential and Realized dimensions on the EO-performance relationship in LMT industries. Our regression results based on a lagged dataset of 103 medium-sized firms based in Italy confirm our hypotheses that, in LMT industries, EO has a positive effect on firm performance when coupled with high levels of both Potential and Realized Absorptive Capacity.

AB	Most studies on absorptive capacity (AC) are based on assumptions that are characteristic of viewing knowledge from an epistemology of possession (knowledge is possessed by individuals and is transferrable). However, the literature on managing knowledge (or better knowledge work) acknowledges also an epistemology of practice (knowledge is unpredictable and dynamic and constituted in and through practice). Moreover, the literature on AC is relatively silent on the relationship between knowledge and power. In this paper, the authors argue that the AC construct should be interpreted in light of the possession and the practice perspectives of knowledge and power. The analysis includes a systematic literature review of AC that supports the authors' claims and, based on this, they suggest an interpretation of the construct that takes into account knowledge-power relationships. This review and theorizing contribute to a richer and processual view of AC.

AB	An important benefit attributed to the activity of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in developing and transition countries is its effect on international market access. Through a variety of channels the presence of MNEs is expected to reduce the costs faced by indigenous firms in breaking into international markets and in turn boost their export prospects. In this paper we use an extensive Polish firm-level dataset for the period 2000-2008 to verify whether MNEs have positively contributed to the export performance of indigenous firms. We track not only sectoral and geographical spillovers stemming from the activity of MNEs but also control for firm-specific characteristics that affect indigenous firms' decisions to export including their absorptive capacity. Our empirical results support the existence of positive spillovers (related to MNE export activity) at the sectoral level but not at the regional level. Finally, we find that individual absorptive capacity determines the size of export spillovers.

AB	The purpose of this study is to explore the determinants and the consequent of absorptive capacity from the resource-capability-performance framework in the Taiwanese manufacturing and service industries. Structural equation modeling is applied to verify the conceptual model. In both of the Taiwanese manufacturing industry and the Taiwanese service industry, this study verifies that resource commitment and resource flexibility are two antecedents of absorptive capacity, and that new product development performance or service innovation performance is its consequent. Besides, the empirical results show that absorptive capacity plays a partial mediator in the manufacturing industry but a full mediator in the service industry. If companies would like to raise their new product development performance or service innovation performance, they have to enhance their resource commitment, resource flexibility, and absorptive capacity. Moreover, this study finds that the resource commitment of small and medium enterprises is significantly less than that of large enterprises in Taiwanese manufacturing industry. This study also finds that resource flexibility of established companies is significantly higher than that of younger companies in Taiwan.

From an analysis of a sample of 199 Flemish start-ups, the study observes that the owners' start-up experience and bridging social capital are positively and significantly related to the new venture's ability to acquire, assimilate and exploit external information. In addition, the findings reveal a positive but decreasing effect of owner-specific human capital as a function of environmental turbulence. Furthermore, the study finds that management experience significantly stimulates start-up absorptive capacity within highly dynamic environments, whereas it hinders it within stable environments.

Besides, this study argues that the antecedents of green organisational ambidexterity are green shared vision and green absorptive capacity and its consequents are green radical innovation performance and green incremental innovation performance. The results demonstrate that green exploration learning partially mediates the positive relationships between green radical innovation performance and its two antecedents-green shared vision and green absorptive capacity. In addition, this study indicates that green exploitation learning partially mediates the positive relationships between green incremental innovation performance and its two antecedents-green shared vision and green absorptive capacity. Hence, firms have to increase their green shared vision, green absorptive capacity, and green organisational ambidexterity to raise their green radical innovation performance and green incremental innovation performance.

AB	Improving organizational performance by redesigning business processes and supporting them with a proper information system is a daunting challenge. We analyze the possibilities of business process management in general and in the healthcare sector in particular. The role of business process modeling as a way to increase an organization's absorptive capacity is analyzed. A longitudinal case study of a European public healthcare insurance company identifies the factors either increasing or hindering absorptive capacity. The case presents that the dilemma between radical and incremental approach to improve business processes is somehow artificial since the radicalness of changes depends on the difference between the absorptive capacity and the extent of the proposed changes. The paper shows that business process management projects should not merely focus on the development of methodologically correct models, but should be used as an opportunity to increase the absorptive capacity of an organization.

AB	Recent reviews of research on innovation in tourism have highlighted a number of weaknesses in the literature. Among these is the limited theorising and empirical investigation of innovative practices by tourism organisations. This paper responds to these concerns by examining one important dimension of innovation within commercial tourism organisations, namely their ability to acquire, assimilate and utilise external knowledge (absorptive capacity) for competitive advantage. The topic is pertinent because there is evidence to suggest that tourism organisations are particularly dependent on external sources of knowledge when compared with businesses in other sectors. Following a discussion of the conceptual antecedents of absorptive capacity and its dimensions, a validated instrument for its measurement is developed and used to measure the absorptive capacity of the British hotel sector. The results suggest that current conceptions of absorptive capacity have limitations when applied to tourism enterprises. Absorptive capacity is re-conceptualised to overcome these deficiencies. The research and policy implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB	In the international business-to-business (B2B) setting, a firm's salespeople often have more direct, prolonged, and intimate contact with the customer and market environments than any other employees of the firm. In fact, for customers in many B2B markets, the salesperson is the face of the firm. The sales function can be characterized as an inherently entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurship is founded on knowing or seeing something others do not see, and the sales force has long been recognized as an important source of knowledge about a firm's customers and environment. However, there has been relatively little work linking entrepreneurship to international sales performance, especially in the B2B context.
This paper focuses on the intelligence-gathering role of salespeople to firms practicing corporate entrepreneurship in the international B2B setting. More specifically, drawing on the theories of corporate entrepreneurship and the knowledge-based view of the firm, the authors develop a conceptual model that proposes international sales performance for firms practicing corporate entrepreneurship will be enhanced when salespeople practice customer-oriented selling and the firm's absorptive capacity is stronger. Recommended methodology for testing the proposed model is a single-informant survey of sales managers with firms in the domain of interest, using structural equation modeling with moderator tests. The paper concludes with implications and directions for future research. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB	Drawing on the studies of relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity, this study examines whether physical and human IT resources deployed in interorganizational relationships influence the development of a firm's IT-enabled capabilities, namely relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity. In addition, the study explores whether these capabilities increase firm performance and also examines the relationship between relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity. To test the hypotheses, we conducted a partial least squares analysis using data collected from 115 firms. The results demonstrate that firms enhanced their relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity by leveraging their physical and human IT resources invested in interorganizational relationships and that these two capabilities increased their performance. Moreover, our results indicate that relationship-specific memory served as a knowledge base for the development of absorptive capacity. The results offer empirical evidence on how firms could improve their performance by internally managing the relational knowledge obtained through their interorganizational relationships.

AB	The aim of this paper is to explore the effects of spillovers driven by competition and forward and backward linkages between foreign firms and Italian firms. We adopt the firm dynamics framework, which allows us to test the impact of foreign firms' activity on the probability that local firms will exit. The empirical analysis relies on continuous survival models (Cox proportional hazard models) and uses a representative firm level database from the period of 2002-2010 with data concerning more than 4,000 Italian manufacturing firms. Our estimates regarding the whole sample show that horizontal and vertical linkages have no impact on firm survival. To further test this finding, we perform a more disaggregated analysis that allows for heterogeneity across firms and sectors. We obtain evidence that the effects of FDI spillovers on firm survival follow specific patterns at both the intra- and inter-industry levels based on differences in productivity between Italian firms and foreign firms and on the technological intensity of the industry. Foreign firms' activity reduces the exit probability of competitors and of downstream local customers (through forward linkages) with low productivity gap but has no impact on high productivity gap firms. Firms in high technology intensive sectors do not benefit from horizontal FDI while in low and medium technology sectors they do. Differences in absorptive capacity may explain these results. However, we also find that vertical linkages with foreign firms in the upstream supplying industries spur firm duration in medium and high tech sectors.

AB	This article explores the potential of university technology business incubators to enhance the absorptive capacity of new technology-based firms. The research pursues three critical themes: it employs the absorptive capacity construct to analyse and evaluate the potential of incubation to strengthen the business model of new technology firms. It then explores the interaction between founders and incubator directors, mentors and business advisers to assess how this might enhance absorptive capacity. Finally, it indicates how such interactions can facilitate the transition from potential to realised absorptive capacity. The article interrogates the incubation process by using the absorptive capacity framework to evaluate how it might strengthen the business model of new technology firms. The qualitative findings suggest that where founders, advisers, mentors and incubator directors engage collaboratively to create an iterative dialogue which informs the development of a viable business model, the process by which potential absorptive capacity can be fully realised is substantially strengthened.

AB	Absorptive capacity is frequently an outcome of a firm's cumulatively path-dependent R&D investments. However, the query how absorptive capacity transforms R&D investment into firm innovation, in the context of autonomous R&D climate remains unclear. Using 165 firms in the Taiwan's information and communication technology industry, the results indicate that absorptive capacity partially mediates the relationship between R&D investment and firm innovation. Absorptive capacity accounts for 36% effects of R&D investment on firm innovation. The result also shows a negative moderating effect of R&D autonomy on the relationship between absorptive capacity and firm innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We tap into this development and complement the existing discussion on combinative capabilities with a perspective that focuses on organizational characteristics that encourage experimentation. Specifically, we argue that characteristics such as slack resources, tolerance for failure, willingness to cannibalize and external openness are important organizational antecedents for knowledge absorption activities as they prevent inertia. Drawing on multi-informant survey data collected from SMEs in Denmark (n = 169), we find empirical support for the impact of these characteristics (except for tolerance for failure) on various aspects of absorptive capacity (both potential and realized). Before concluding, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships among organizational learning, absorptive capacity, imitation and innovation in the Chinese context.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on the organizational learning theory and innovation theory, the paper presents a framework linking organizational learning, absorptive capacity, imitation and innovation. Using a key informant technique, a survey questionnaire was designed and sent to the middle or top management managers of 115 firms located in Peking, People's Republic (PR) of China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedures was applied to test the hypotheses developed in the research.
Findings - The empirical results show that both organizational learning and absorptive capacity have positive impacts on innovation; imitation has a positive impact on absorptive capacity; absorptive capacity mediates the relationship between imitation and innovation.
Practical implications - This study has implications for firms aiming to enhance innovation by organizational learning, absorptive capacity and imitation.
Originality/value - Despite the number of studies concerning organizational learning, absorptive capacity, imitation and innovation, research that encompasses the interrelationships between the four concepts simultaneously remains scarce. The paper provides a framework linking organizational learning, imitation, absorptive capacity and innovation, and it advances the argument that absorptive capacity is an important factor in predicting the Chinese firms' transition from imitation to innovation.

(2012) and thus was based on categories, conceptualizations, levels of analysis and, additionally, temporal evolution of absorptive capacity from 1990 to 2013 was looked at. Text analysis was performed to identify major research themes developing the absorptive capacity construct.
Findings - Finding showed that absorptive capacity was largely underdeveloped in the KM and IC fields. KM, knowledge transfer and innovation were the top three research areas investigating absorptive capacity in the KM and IC fields. Research limitations/implications - This study had limitations related to time frame, covering a period from April 1990 to November 2013, and accessibility of articles due to specific restrictions in journal subscriptions.
Originality/value - This paper is a first attempt to review absorptive capacity in KM and IC research. It represented a primary reference for those interested to research absorptive capacity in the KM and IC fields.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore cross-sector partnerships (CSSPs) from a strategic perspective to consider collaborations that are long lasting and transcend initial objectives. The authors integrate the concept of absorptive capacity (ACAP) with the CSSP literature and derive two new antecedents of ACAP, trust and goal interdependency, with relevance to this context. This work responds to a call from ACAP scholars to consider the construct in alternative settings and from collaboration scholars to employ strategy research that approaches CSSPs from a viewpoint beyond a mere transactional approach.
Design/methodology/approach - This manuscript presents a thorough analysis of the process literature regarding CSSPs and the construct of ACAP to consider the importance of knowledge sharing and participatory decision making in the success of collaboration efforts. The combination of these research streams results in a refined model of ACAP to be used in the CSSP context.
Findings - This manuscript provides conceptual and theoretical insights into how knowledge is acquired and exploited within CSSPs. A model for ACAP in CSSPs is proposed and suggests that two new antecedents of ACAP, trust and goal interdependence, be explored in this context through subsequent empirical research.
Research limitations/implications - This type of conceptual work can benefit greatly from subsequent empirical research to test the developed propositions. This model shows considerable promise for future testing, however, and has the potential to encourage additional research into knowledge sharing and long-term success of cross-sector collaborations.
Practical implications - This paper fulfills the need to apply a strategic lens to CSSPs and invites future research into the mutual organizational benefits derived from collaborations that cross economic sectors. It suggests that internal organizational mechanisms exist to be developed by managers that have the potential to enhance a firms ability to recognize the value of external knowledge, acquire it, and transform it for commercial and/or social objectives.
Social implications - As collaborations across economic sectors are proving vital for addressing complex social needs, this manuscript provides a new model to serve as a guidepost for successful partnerships.
Originality/value - This manuscript fulfills a need to integrate strategy scholarship with CSSPs that transcends the heretofore transactional perspective. Through an exploration of the literature, a new model for ACAP is proposed including two new antecedents, trust and goal interdependence, with application to the context of cross-sector collaborations.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine what types of shipping knowledge are crucial in order for shipping companies to survive in dynamic business environment, and to investigate how the shipping knowledge affects the company's performance (i.e. organizational innovation and logistics value). This paper also diagnoses the moderating effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between the shipping knowledge and its effectiveness.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on the literature, a theoretical framework and relevant hypotheses are established so as to show associated relationships between shipping knowledge, absorptive capacity, and organizational innovation and logistics value. Data are collected for an empirical analysis and a moderated hierarchical regression analysis is conducted to test the hypotheses.
Findings - Results show that a high level of shipping knowledge has a positive influence on the organizational innovation and logistics value of shipping companies. The findings also indicate that, while the absorptive capacity of shipping companies moderates the positive impact of shipping knowledge on the logistics value, it directly affects the improvement of organizational innovation.
Research limitations/implications - This research verifies that effective knowledge management of shipping companies plays a significant role in developing organizational innovation and improving logistics performance. The research findings provide shipping companies with a strategic insight into the identification of critical sources for competitive advantage and greater organizational performance from an organizational learning perspective.
Practical implications - This line of research is served as an indicator of a good strategic direction for the practitioners engaged in the maritime transport and logistics industry, in order for them to become better integrated entities in a global logistics system as well as maximize their competitive advantages.
Originality/value - This paper makes the first attempt in its kind at empirically examining the types of shipping knowledge and its overall effectiveness in terms of the improvement of organizational innovation and logistics value. The moderating role of absorptive capacity on the impact of knowledge on organizational performance has also been initiated in the maritime logistics research.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of a manufacturer's absorptive capacity (AC) on its mass customization capability (MCC).
Design/methodology/approach - The authors conceptualize AC within the supply chain context as four processes: knowledge acquisition from customers, knowledge acquisition from suppliers, knowledge assimilation, and knowledge application. The authors then propose and empirically test a model on the relationships among AC processes and MCC using structural equation modeling and data collected from 276 manufacturing firms in China.
Findings - The results show that AC significantly improves MCC. In particular, knowledge sourced from customers and suppliers enhances MCC in three ways: directly, indirectly through knowledge application, and indirectly through knowledge assimilation and application. The study also finds that knowledge acquisition significantly enhances knowledge assimilation and knowledge application, and that knowledge assimilation leads to knowledge application.
Originality/value - This study provides empirical evidence of the effects of AC processes on MCC. It also indicates the relationships among AC processes. Moreover, it reveals the mechanisms through which knowledge sourced from customers and suppliers contributes to MCC development, and demonstrates the importance of internal knowledge management practices in exploiting knowledge from supply chain partners. Furthermore, it provides guidelines for executives to decide how to manage supply chain knowledge and devote their efforts and resources in absorbing new knowledge for MCC development.

AB	Purpose - This paper aims to ask the question of the contingency of a firm's absorptive capacity upon the type of expected outcome. Thus, this paper looks at different expected outputs in terms of more or less radical innovations and sees if there are consequences on the absorptive process underpinning cognitive structures and processes, as embodied in its organizational and social capital.
Design/methodology/approach - To do so, a qualitative study was conducted. In total, 23 persons in three French industrial firms were interviewed about their firm's absorptive capacity. One of these firms aims at "new-to-the-firm" innovations, while the other two aim at "new-to-the-world" innovations.
Findings - Results suggest that while "new-to-the-firm" innovations tend to favor the use of social capital, "new-to-the-world" innovations tend to rely more on organizational capital. These rather counterintuitive results are interpreted by the necessity to take into account other variables than knowledge distance in the absorption of new knowledge. In particular, complexity and time-length would call for greater use of organizational capital, while speed and reactivity would instead require greater use of social capital.
Originality/value - This is to the best of the authors' knowledge that one of the first study evidencing the contingent nature of the absorptive process. Further, results tend to show the form absorptive capacity takes depends not only on cognitive aspects but also on the particular environment the firm evolves in.

AB	Different from previous studies that tend to use in-house research and development (R&D) as a proxy for absorptive capacity but fail to reveal the origins of this R&D ability, this paper attempts to determine the origin of absorptive capacity (AC) after defining such concept as the capability of a firm to conduct in-house R&D and to generate innovation outcomes. This paper distinguishes three forms of foreign technology acquisitions based on unique data from Korea, namely, know-how-only licensing, know-how-and-patent licensing, and patent-only licensing. An econometric analysis demonstrates that a firm tends to involve know-how licensing before it starts in-house R&D, whereas patent licensing is not significantly related to conducting R&D. Therefore, a substitution effect is found between foreign patent licensing and conducting in-house R&D, which is in contrast to the inducing effect of know-how licensing for in-house R&D. It is also found that conducting in-house R&D, and know-how licensing by a firm, respectively, is significantly related to a generation of innovations or patent applications in next periods. This study shows that a learning process that involves foreign technology, especially tacit knowledge in the form of know-how, occurs before firms can conduct in-house R&D and innovations.

Defining convergence as an inherently stable process of structuring inter-technological patterns over time, German patent data are used to project them onto the structure of the output of standards via a concordance list of International Patent Classifications (IPC) symbols and International Classification of Standards (ICS) classes. Using a set of criteria for a reliable measurement of technological convergence, a set of methods, such as explorative identification of agglomerations of technical fields, the analyses of the breadth of technical fields to differentiate between focused and diffused convergence trends and in-depth analysis using a revised version of the Cross-Impact Assessment method, are devised to measure the level and trend of technological convergence. The structures of convergence in technological development and standardisation are in general moderately positively correlated, but that there are significant differences on how these converging trends are covered in the stock of active standards at the level of technical fields.

AB	Absorptive capacity is a dynamic capability which creates new firm resources by searching, acquiring, assimilating, transforming and exploiting external knowledge with internal resources and act as a process framework for innovation. Despite being one of the most frequently cited strategic management concepts, absorptive capacity as a dynamic capability has limited empirical evidence with unverified assumptions. The concept is at risk of reification. With this study we contribute to the literature by providing empirical evidence for absorptive capacity which challenge the assumptions of how the construct is configured. We follow the strategic factor of intellectual property rights (IPR) in European biopharmaceutical firms using a qualitative process study with temporal bracketing. By tracking IPR, we found evidence for absorptive capacity in all firms we studied, but the process framework in use is different to Zahra and George's (2002. Acad. Manage. Rev. 27,185-203) and Todorova and Durisin's (2007. Acad. Manage. Rev. 32,774-786) theoretical models. Based on our evidence and literature review we develop some theoretical insights and propose a modified absorptive capacity model. This new model puts a greater emphasis on assimilating knowledge from outside the firm and provides more clarity on how research intensive firms might use absorptive capacity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB	This paper investigates productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) and the absorptive capacity of domestic firms using the firm level data of South Korean manufacturing industries. This paper finds that the absorptive capacity has as a role in mitigating the negative spillovers from FDI by capturing additional positive spillovers from FDI. Thus, firms without any absorptive capacity suffer more from FDI than firms with absorptive capacity. However, when the endogeneity problems in absorptive capacity such as R&D and export activity variables are considered, the role of absorptive capacity becomes too insignificant to alleviate the negative spillovers from FDI. In addition, the results from simultaneous quantile regression indicate that the effect of R&D and export activity to absorb the additional spillovers is heterogeneous depending on the conditional productivity distribution.

Seven explorative case studies were conducted in an R&D and business context of two large global high-tech companies. The results suggest that if the necessary conditions are met, social media usage increases the transparent, moderational and multi-directional interactions that in turn influence four capabilities for absorptive capacity: connectedness, socialization tactics, cross-functionality and receptivity, a hitherto overlooked capability. Hence, we observe that social media are boundary-spanning tools that can be used to build and increase companies' absorptive capacity.

AB	Recent studies have separately investigated the importance of regional innovation systems (RISs) and absorptive capacity (AC) to innovation performance. This study explores their interdependency on the premise that better utilization of RIS enhances innovation performance because the RIS enhances the absorptive capacity of the firm. In this study, we cover three typical elements of RIS: regional innovation initiatives (RII), knowledge-intensive business services (KIBSs) and value chain information sources. This study explores the relationships of these elements on the acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation learning processes of absorptive capacity. Data were obtained through a mailed survey using a self-administered questionnaire. The results show that RII, KIBS and value chain information sources affect a firm's absorptive capacity, leading to better innovation performance. Specifically, KIBS improves the acquisition process, value chain information sources improve the acquisition and assimilation processes, and RII improve the transformation process. This study contributes to the literature by exploring how a firm interacts with RIS by utilizing various RIS initiatives to enhance the firm's absorptive capacity and innovation performance. It also increases our understanding of how AC learning processes relate to RIS and innovation performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB	This paper focuses on the moderating role of a firm's absorptive capacity in realizing innovation benefits from the firm's alliance network technological resources. We conceptualize absorptive capacity along two dimensions technological effort and technological capability and hypothesize that these two dimensions have opposing moderating effects which can result in theoretical and empirical misspecifications if ignored. We argue that firms with higher technological efforts have greater motivation to search for knowledge from their alliance partners, place more value on the external knowledge and mobilize such knowledge, and face lower internal resistance to assimilate and to use the knowledge. On the other hand, firms with stronger technological capability have lower motivation to search for knowledge from alliance partners, put lower value on the knowledge, make less intense efforts to mobilize it, and face greater internal resistance in assimilating and using the knowledge. By analyzing longitudinal data of 178 U.S.-based public semiconductor firms during 1988-2000 using negative binomial regression, we find that as firms increase their technological effort, the benefits from alliance network resources in terms of technological innovations come at a higher rate. In contrast, as technological capabilities of firms increase, the benefits from the alliance network resources in the form firm technological innovations come at a lower rate. We further discuss important theoretical and managerial implications of our findings. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB	Using disaggregated FDI data on 12 new member states of the European Union from 1999 to 2010, this paper examines whether different types of FDI have differential effects on economic growth. Our results show that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and greenfield investment do not on their own have significant growth effects in these economies. In both cases, the availability of absorptive capacity plays an important role in stimulating their growth effects. Moreover, a developed financial system complements the impact of M& As on economic growth, while a minimum threshold level of human capital needs to be reached so that greenfield investment is beneficial for economic growth. Domestic investment is revealed to be a consistent contributor to economic growth.

AB	While learning plays an important role in firms' internationalization process, the impact absorptive capacity has on the international performance when considering the timing of the internationalization is still unclear. Our research explores the role of absorptive capacity in international performance of early internationalizing firms and international experienced firms. Combining established theories, we propose opposing effect of absorptive capacity as the learning advantages of newness vanish over time and are replaced by organizational rigidities and inertia. Based on survey data from 162 Chinese firms, our empirical results indicate that the influence of absorptive capacity on international performance becomes stronger when the firm enters foreign market in its earlier stage of life cycle. However, we find that as the learning advantages of newness diminish, so does the effectiveness of high levels of absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity resources become captured by organizational and operational rigidities and contribute less to firm performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The level of disclosure required in such contract is higher, the more capable is the South in copying if bargaining breaks down. This raises questions about the suitability of universal IPR standards through a single contract. The threat of a penalty in case of non-compliance can, however, reduce the outside option of more advanced countries and make a stricter IPR regime enforceable by harmonizing their interests with relatively less developed nations.

AB	We explain why companies seeking superior product innovation should invest in basic research. Our arguments highlight the role of absorptive capacity and examine how industry appropriability influences these relations. Based on a rich dataset of 8 416 firms, we argue that basic research in firms increases their knowledge stock and flows, therefore improving their capacity to identify, assimilate, and exploit external knowledge, which allows them to enhance their product innovation performance. We also verify that strong appropriability regimes not only reduce the effect of basic research on absorptive capacity, but also affect the relation between absorptive capacity and product innovation in two ways. In businesses with a high absorptive capacity, strong appropriability regimes exert a negative influence by reducing product innovation; however, businesses with a low absorptive capacity see their level of product innovation increase. This evidence not only throws into question the attitude of many managers toward basic research; it also calls for open reflection on both the net effect of appropriability on innovative performance and the stages of the innovation process to which public resources should be allocated.

The paper uses an unbalanced panel of 274 regions over 8 years to estimate a regional knowledge production function with fixed-effects. It finds evidence that inflows of inventors are critical for wealthier regions, while it has more nuanced effects for less developed areas. It also shows that regions' absorptive capacity critically adds a premium to tap into remote knowledge pools conveyed by mobility and networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is still not clear how this effect takes place and what internal capabilities are involved in the process. We propose to open the black box between external knowledge search strategies, and innovation and performance by proposing absorptive capacity (AC) as the mediating variable. A sample of 102 biotechnology firms from Spain is used to test the proposed theoretical model through structural equation modeling taking the partial least squares approach. Results suggest that AC acts as a full mediator in the relationship between the depth of external knowledge search and the innovation and business performance of the firm. Finally, some suggestions for managers and future lines of research are highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

Drawing on a database of 127 science-to-industry R&D projects in technology-based markets, our study results show the inherent relevance of complexity and absorptive capabilities for value creation. Contrary to expectations, prior knowledge has no significant effect on value creation per se. Instead, the impact of complex technological knowledge on value creation is enhanced at high levels of both prior knowledge and absorptive capabilities. The findings suggest that following a well-worn path leads to competence traps, whereas knowledge-related learning capabilities enable a firm to deal with dynamic environments. The findings have implications for managerial decisions and theory regarding how value can be created from complex knowledge in technology transfer settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using structural equation modeling in a sample of 158 firms (316 questionnaires, two respondents per firm) from South Korea's semiconductor industry, we find that a firm's ACAP leads to better performance in terms of new product development, market performance and profitability when used in combination with the firm's capability to engage state of the art technologies in its new product development program (NPD) (technological capability) as well as cultivate strong customer relationships to gain customer insight in NPD (customer relationship capability). By highlighting the interactive nature of absorptive capacity's antecedents and how these relate to firms' performance, this study contributes to the understanding of the role of ACAP as a mechanism for translating external knowledge into tangible benefits in high-tech SMEs, thus leading to important theoretical and practical implications.

AB	Knowledge, as resource, and technological innovation, as a dynamic capability, are key sources for firm's sustained competitive advantage and survival in knowledge-based and high-tech industries. Under this rationale has emerged a research stream where knowledge management, organizational learning, or intellectual capital, help to understand and constitute the key pieces of one of the most complex business phenomena; the 'firm's technological advantage'. This being so, it is also true that in knowledge-bated and high-tech industrial markets, competitive success comes directly from continuous technological innovations, where a single organization cannot successfully innovate in isolation; therefore, firms should rely on external relationships and networks in order to complement its knowledge domains, and then, develop better and faster innovations. In this sense, I would like to highlight the cross-fertilizing role of three constructs that are nurtured by different research traditions; 'collaborative/open innovation', from Strategy and Innovation Management research; 'absorptive capacity', from 'A Knowledge-Based View'; and 'market orientation', from Marketing research.

AB	Although the benefits of clustering for innovation have received much attention in the theoretical as well as empirical literature, analyses at the regional level often disregard the characteristics of local firms. We tackle both at the same time: agglomeration externalities (Marshall, Porter, Jacobs) from census microdata, and firm data from the Community Innovation Survey. Importantly, we allow for sectoral heterogeneity of agglomeration forces. We find that the firm characteristics, including those that proxy for absorptive capacity', have a much stronger relationship with the propensity to innovate than regular agglomeration externalities. The latter are only statistically significant for a few specific sectors, and even then only for some types of innovation. Sorting of innovation-prone firms into specific locations might therefore be much more important to explain spatial patterns of innovation than agglomeration externalities.

Based on data from 608 firms in Austria, Brazil, Germany, India, Singapore, and the USA, we analyze how absorptive capacity can be fostered through different leadership styles and whether national culture moderates this relationship. We reveal that transformational and transactional leadership have a positive impact on absorptive capacity, which is moderated by power distance and uncertainty avoidance. Overall, the study's findings enable managers to foster knowledge absorption and innovation generation in an international context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB	Researchers have made significant strides toward understanding how absorptive capacity influences firm performance. However, most of these developments have been theoretical in nature, and have been conducted in single-firm contexts. Our study answers prior calls for more empirical and mathematical treatments in multi-firm contexts that nurture a vibrant and balanced research stream. Our study adopts a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the influence of absorptive capacity on the performance of a firm in a dynamic multi-firm context. We develop a theoretical framework that drives the modeling exercise to gain insights on two research questions: (1) Relative to the dominant player in the industry, what level of ACap should a firm be endowed with to increase its long-term value in a dynamic environment? (2) Is there a threshold value of ACap endowment that makes it more likely for a firm to challenge the dominant player in the industry? We provide an analytical result, and further, we conduct a numerical study with two firms and seven periods. Our results suggest that there are ACap hurdle rates that a firm must meet to survive and grow. In addition, our model suggests that smaller firms in an industry may do well to strive for unique combinations of ACap, prior knowledge, and initial firm value, to compete successfully against the dominant player in the industry. Our work serves to open new avenues for future research that addresses the influence of ACap endowments on firm performance in dynamic multi-firm environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Focusing on the territorial dimension, we investigated the role played by shared vision in the effects of internal resources (absorptive capacity) and external resources (network positioning) on the innovation of firms. To address the research questions, the empirical study drew on a sample of firms belonging to the Valencian textile cluster in Spain. Our findings suggest that networking and firm resources affect performance independently. Furthermore, internal and relational resources are positively active thanks to shared vision. More generally, we aim to contribute to the discussion on the degree to which firms should be involved in the cluster network in order to gain competitive advantages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB	While 'open innovation' is often considered to be an organisational strategy with universal application, its generalisability and applicability to organisations operating within emerging economies has yet to be fully explored. This study provides empirical evidence of its importance within a substantial sample of Chinese large firms and small and medium enterprises. Using Tobit regression analysis, our findings indicate that external knowledge sources from inter-firm networking are more important in creating the benefits of open innovation for Chinese small and medium enterprises than their larger peers. Linkages to university and research institutes generally have few direct effects on the innovation performance of both large and small firms in China. However, the role of universities and research institutes is shown to be important among our large firm sample when combined with evident internal absorptive capacity. This interaction is generally limited to our large firm sample, and is not as evident among small firms.
Our study indicates that the barriers to the adoption of open innovation by Chinese firms might be largely related to the comparatively weak domestic research expertise and limited organisational absorptive capabilities, with this most particularly evident for small and medium enterprises.
These findings suggest that, based on this evidence, there is no need for emerging economies like China to mimic the emergence path from closed to open innovation followed by developed countries. Chinese firms will be more likely to garner the benefits available from openness when they develop the capabilities required to identify, assimilate and commercialise knowledge and technologies obtained from external sources.

AB	This study aims to contribute to the literature through the theoretical development and empirical investigation of the role of information technology use in organizational learning. We develop a theoretical framework that unpacks organizational learning into mechanisms and outcomes. The outcomes of organizational learning are distinguished at two levels: first-order and second-order. Based on the framework, we propose a research model set in the franchising context. We conceptualize franchisee use of IT provided by the franchisor as an important learning mechanism that impacts knowledge transfer effectiveness (first-order outcome) and absorptive capacity (second-order outcome). Further, the influence of IT use on financial performance is mediated through absorptive capacity. The model was tested on a sample of 783 independently owned real-estate franchisees using a comprehensive dataset comprised of primary and secondary data. The results indicate that IT use is an important learning mechanism for franchisees by impacting knowledge transfer effectiveness and absorptive capacity. In turn, absorptive capacity mediates the relationship between IT use and financial performance. The empirical support for the research model serves to affirm the underlying learning mechanisms-outcomes framework. The results are stable across the choice of statistical method and the operationalization of financial performance. Theoretical contributions, implications for practice, and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB	Information management is a core supply chain activity that is increasing in importance as firms strive to become more responsive to growing customer demand for innovative products. However, effective processing of information from customers and suppliers remains a struggle for most firms. Absorptive capacity provides a useful view of information processing activities, but the current understanding of how firms use it to improve performance and why some firms seem to develop it while others do not remains unclear. This study is grounded in information processing theory, and examines the role of absorptive capacity in linking a firm's responsive strategy and performance. We test a structural equation model on data from 711 manufacturing firms, and validate our results on a second sample of 677 firms. Our study makes three major contributions by providing evidence that: (1) absorptive capacity is motivated by a firm's responsive strategy; (2) it fully mediates the relationship between responsive strategy and firm performance, indicating that absorptive capacity is a necessary competence for firms that aim to deliver innovative products to customers; and (3) the relationship between responsive strategy and absorptive capacity is U-shaped, indicating that when firms attempt to blend efficient and responsive strategies, their ability to develop absorptive capacity is diminished.

Results of a survey study of 588 manufacturing SMEs indicate that e-business capabilities have a significant impact on internationalization performance to the extent that these capabilities are developed as a response to increased environmental uncertainty. Moreover, these capabilities are realized through the development of networking, advanced manufacturing, and marketing capabilities that also respond to environmental uncertainty.

AB	Research on organizational learning from performance feedback has produced findings on how organizational change is influenced by performance relative to aspiration levels, but has focused on short-term goal variables. In this article, we examine how short- and long-term goals are related to short- and long-term actions, respectively. We do so by predicting changes in absorptive capacity from performance relative to aspiration levels, and by testing whether long-term goals mainly affect potential absorptive capacity, which has long-term effects, while short-term goals mainly affect the realized absorptive capacity, which has short-term effects. Using data from surveys of 252 decision makers representing 129 Israeli early-stage high-tech organizations, our analysis yields supportive empirical findings. The findings imply that performance relative to aspiration levels has effects on long-term strategic actions as well as short-term ones, and thus argue against strict myopia.

AB	According to the perspective of entrepreneurial orientation-as-experimentation, entrepreneurial orientation (EO) increases variability in innovation outcomes. Although increased variability in the innovation portfolio could increase performance, it could also lead to a decline in performance. We propose that absorptive capacity plays a role in both increasing and managing variations in innovation outcomes. Potential absorptive capacity enhances the effects of EO on variability in innovation outcomes, whereas realized absorptive capacity helps transform and exploit variability in innovation outcomes to enhance firm performance.

AB	Prior research has acknowledged the importance of an organization's absorptive capacitythe ability to acquire new knowledge and information, assimilate, transform, and exploit itfor innovation purposes. Because innovations are usually developed by project teams, this suggests that absorptive capacity, as a construct, may also be usefully applied at the team level. Consequently, this study developed a measure for team-level absorptive capacity, investigated the potential influencing factors, and examined its relationship to team effectiveness in terms of product innovativeness in an interorganizational context. Specifically, building on the theory of homophily and information and decision-making theories, three factors (social-category similarity, work-style similarity, and knowledge complementarity between the recipient and the partner organization teams) were identified as likely antecedents of team absorptive capacity. The hypotheses were tested on data from 98 interorganizational new product development teams and included responses from team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. With regard to the antecedents of team absorptive capacity in interorganizational settings, the results showed a significant positive association with partners' work-style similarity and an inverted U-shaped relationship with partners' knowledge complementarity. Social-category similarity was not significantly associated with team absorptive capacity. We also examined whether team absorptive capacity was related to interorganizational team effectiveness and found a significant positive relationship between team absorptive capacity and product innovativeness. The study demonstrates that absorptive is indeed related to team effectiveness outcomes in an interorganizational context, which underlines the importance of team-level absorptive capacity for product innovation management and suggests paying more attention to the lower levels of absorptive capacity.

However, the positive relationship between management practices and absorptive capacity is only significant for transforming and exploiting external knowledge in R&D projects.

AB	A firm's absorptive capacity involves two dimensions: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal dimension refers to a dynamic interplay between internal and external environments of the firm, which is extensively covered in the absorptive capacity research. However, the literature ignores vertical dimension involving individual-organization interactions. Scant knowledge is available about the mechanisms through which absorptive capacity emerges as an organizational learning capability. This study reviews the seminal works of Cohen and Levinthal and finds that the stickiness of knowledge, the multiple antecedents of absorptive capacity and their interattions are explicitly addressed therein, but are insufficiently problematized in subsequent research. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm and the micro-foundations lens of organizational capabilities, the present study re-conceptualizes absorptive capacity as a set of three sequentially linked learning processes where individual and organizational antecedents interact, and explains how value recognition, assimilation and application capabilities emerge as organizational (macro) level phenomena.

Using a recent firm-level survey for 19 Sub-Saharan African countries, the paper shows that there is a positive and significant relationship between importing and productivity for both manufacturing and services firms. Using a series of robustness tests, the paper finds that the importer-productivity relationship is robust in the case of manufacturing firms, but the results for services appear sensitive to the presence of extreme values. Finally, the paper shows that manufacturing firms with the highest levels of human capital show the strongest relationship between importing and productivity, a result consistent with a role for absorptive capacity in maximising the benefits of importing.

AB	Being "green" is socially, desirable, yet whether it pays to be "green" is unclear. This question has become more important to manufacturing industries as environmental concerns are escalating, particularly in emerging economies. We examine the effects of green process innovation on the financial performance of manufacturing industries with a focus on the moderating effects of government subsidies versus industries' own absorptive capability. Using sulfur dioxide emissions as an environmental index, we establish a dynamic model using ten years panel data from 28 industries in China where environmental concerns have been severe and government subsidies have been commonly believed to be instrumental. The results show that clean technologies and end-of-pipe technologies are positively related to financial performance at the industry level, thus it pays to be "green." Furthermore, strong absorptive capacity tends to enhance this relationship, but surprisingly green subsidies turn out to weaken this relationship. We also find the effects are different between clean technologies and end-of-pile technologies, which leads to finer grained insights into these two types of technologies and their adoption. We conclude that manufacturing industries can benefit more from green process innovation by leveraging their internal absorptive capability, as opposed to replying on external government subsidies as commonly believed. Our findings provide finer grained insights on the benefits of green process innovation, and shed light on the study of green process innovation in other emerging economies.

AB	Extant literature on firm-university collaboration has emphasized two different strategies that firms in science-based industries adopt to source scientific knowledge and expertise. On one hand, firms engage in direct research collaborations with universities. On the other hand, firms establish indirect, mediated, ties to universities by engaging in research collaborations with dedicated biotech firms that are themselves strongly linked to universitieswith the dedicated biotech firm taking the role of broker. We argue that the relative benefits of direct and mediated ties depend on the extent to which firms have organized their research and development to facilitate the absorption, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation of scientific knowledge, which we coin scientific absorptive capacity. Drawing on patent and publication data in a panel of 33 vertically integrated pharmaceutical firms, we find that direct university collaboration is more beneficial for firms with relatively high scientific absorptive capacity, while only mediated ties are associated with greater innovative performance for firms with relatively low scientific absorptive capacity. The latter association is reduced if the mediated ties are with top universities. Our findings are suggestive of the importance of a fit between the nature of a firm's research and development organization and its strategy to access scientific knowledge.

AB	How can a firm develop new ideas and turn them into profitable innovations on a sustained basis? We address this fundamental issue in a novel way by developing an integrative framework of absorptive capacity (AC) and inbound open innovation that is rooted in the attention-based view of the firm. We specifically address why a balance between open and closed innovation is important from the perspective of absorptive capacity, and show how it may be brought about. Pursuing either open or closed inbound innovation alone may result in an imbalance between potential AC and realized AC as well as inward-looking AC and outward-looking AC, which will hinder innovative performance. We argue that practicing open and closed inbound innovation repeatedly and alternately by switching organizational attentions, and thus developing the associated AC, can facilitate balancing absorptive capacity and lead to innovative performance.

AB	Since the Cohen and Levinthal article on absorptive capacity was published, 'the ability to recognize the value of new information, to assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends' (p. 128) is seen as an essential competence for a firm's long-term performance. However, the way absorptive capacity is actually implemented in firms remains relatively poorly known. The few existing works present absorptive capacity as an essentially linear process, and the way the different phases of this process are actually carried out remains understudied. In order to enhance our understanding of the way firms absorb external knowledge, we gathered data from 23 interviews of managers from three different industrial firms. Our results suggest that, far from being linear, the process displays several feedback loops, both within and between each phase of absorption. In this study, we enrich previous absorptive capacity models.

AB	Increased understanding of knowledge transfer (KT) from universities to the wider regional knowledge ecosystem offers opportunities for increased regional innovation and commercialisation. The aim of this article is to improve the understanding of the KT phenomena in an open innovation context where multiple diverse quadruple helix stakeholders are interacting. An absorptive capacity-based conceptual framework is proposed, using a priori constructs which portrays the multidimensional process of KT between universities and its constituent stakeholders in pursuit of open innovation and commercialisation. Given the lack of overarching theory in the field, an exploratory, inductive theory building methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews, document analysis and longitudinal observation data over a three-year period. The findings identify five factors, namely human centric factors, organisational factors, knowledge characteristics, power relationships and network characteristics, which mediate both the ability of stakeholders to engage in KT and the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. This research has implications for policy makers and practitioners by identifying the need to implement interventions to overcome the barriers to KT effectiveness between regional quadruple helix stakeholders within an open innovation ecosystem.

AB	This paper extends the existing literature on strategic R&D alliances by presenting a model of innovation networks with endogenous absorptive capacity. The networks emerge as a result of dynamic cooperation between firms occupying different locations in the knowledge space. Partner selection is driven by absorptive capacity which is itself influenced by cognitive distance and R&D investment allocation. Under different knowledge regimes, we examine the structure of networks that emerge and how firms perform within such networks. We find networks that exhibit small world properties which are generally robust to changes in the knowledge regime. Certain network strategies such as occupying brokerage positions or maximising accessibility to potential partners pay off, especially in 'young' industries with limited involuntary but abundant voluntary spillovers. This particular result is driven by endogenous absorptive capacity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB	China's global export rank rose from the 32nd in 1978 to the 1st in 2009, and in the same period China had been a top recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world. Does large FDI inflow automatically lead to the export boom? Or is it a must for China to have certain absorptive capacity (AC) given FDI? This work investigates how manufacturing exports (MX) are affected by the AC-FDI interaction. MX performance is assessed by three indicators: export capacity, export intensity, and export quality. AC is defined as a host-country's ability to capture potential benefits from FDI, and such ability is proxied by govemment FDI policy, human capital, R&D, and infrastructure. Estimates are conducted with the data on 21 manufacturing sectors for 31 regions over 8 years (2005-2012). We find that (a) AC is necessary condition for China to benefit from FDI in MX, and contributions of FDI alone to MX are limited; (b) China's strong AC largely comes from well-designed FDI policy and high quality infrastructure, both of which complement with FDI in strengthening export capacity, intensity and quality; and (c) human capital and R&D seems to be more helpful for China to capture spillovers from FDI to export quality.

AB	An important challenge in open innovation is the capability to absorb and exploit external inbound knowledge, and how internal R&D may facilitate or hinder this. Conventionally, internal R&D expenditure is used as a proxy for absorptive capacity, but in the context of open innovation, this can be problematic. Internal R&D may also constrain present and future absorption, and restrict exploitation for a number of reasons, e.g. degree of development, structural, geographical or relevance to existing business units and markets. Conversely, external sources of innovation can be difficult to identify, evaluate and absorb, but may be more codified, as by definition they are available in the market, and more fully-developed to demonstrate commercial potential. Using panel data of 325 firms over five years, we find that contrary to the prescriptions of transaction cost analysis, externally-sourced knowledge takes less time to absorb and exploit than internally-generated knowledge, but that internal knowledge creates higher returns over the longer term. Significantly, the relationship between internal and external knowledge and performance changes over time, while the ideal strategic balance needs to consider decisions taken at different times.

AB	Numerous studies examine the importance of training on organizational performance, albeit without resolving how the transformation process occurs. This study bridges this research gap. The study presents a model that shows that absorptive capacity, particularly exploitation capability, mediates the relationship between training and organizational performance. Three analysis methods converge with the findings: case studies (6 cases), PLS-SEM (112 cases), and fsQCA (25 cases). Using these three data analysis methods in a single piece of research represents a considerable methodological contribution and enables the confirmation of the model's validity and robustness. Another of the contributions is that the use of fsQCA overcomes other methods' deficiencies. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
